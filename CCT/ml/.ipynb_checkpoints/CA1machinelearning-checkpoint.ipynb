    "Higher level education is one of the core government concerns in most of countries with high stakes for the long term sucess of such countries. From a governement policy perspective understanding students interests and identifying discontent and possiblity of drop out is essential. As the scale of classrooms and universities increases it's undoable to individually understand each student, so automated technices become crucial. This work is motivated by the possiblity of machine learning models to be trained to predict the probability of drop out of students given their background and context they are in. To achieve this I will use a class"
