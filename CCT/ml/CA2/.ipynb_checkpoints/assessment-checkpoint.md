Background:
Assume you are given the opportunity to work as a Data Scientist for a global bike rental firm that has
operations in New York, London, Berlin, Chicago, San Francisco, Dublin, and other locations. The company
offers three different bike kinds for rent: Standard, Mountain, and Electric. With 900 rows and a variety of
features/ attributes/ columns, including City, Weather, Rider Age, Bike Model, Ride Length, Distance
Covered, Rider Satisfaction, and Bike Rental Cost, the dataset is available on Moodle.
The company is interested to leverage the provided dataset to improve operational efficiency, customer
satisfaction, and pricing strategies. Your task is to understand and analyze the patterns in the customer
behavior and bike rental usage across different cities, weather conditions, bike models, and age groups.
Your analysis will guide the company to plan for the future and make data-driven decisions on bike fleet
management, pricing adjustments, and customer satisfaction improvements.
Assessment Details:
    Your responsibility is to analyze the provided dataset to address key business based objectives. The analysis
    will be splitted into two parts: Data Preparation and Machine Learning Modeling. These analyses will help
    the company understand customer preferences and enhance their services.
    Data Preparation
        1. Characterisation of the data set: size; number of attributes; has/does not have missing values,
        number of observations etc.[0-10]
        2. Application of Data preparation/evaluation methods (Cleaning, renaming, etc) and EDA (Exploratory
        Data Analysis) visualizations (plural), including a clear and concise explanation of your rationale for
        what you are doing with the data and why you are doing it.[0-20]
        3. Apply encoding, scaling and feature engineering as and if required, detailing how and why you used
        these techniques and the rationale for your decisions.[0-30]
        4. Explore the possibility of using dimensional reduction on the dataset. Employ both LDA (Linear
        Discriminant Analysis) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and compare the separation of
        classes through visualization. Explain the difference between both techniques in your own words
        and discuss in detail how your results may affect your analysis of classifying, clustering or
        prediction.[0-40]
    Machine Learning
        1. Provide a conceptual understanding and logical justification based on the reasoning for the specific
        choice of machine learning approach (supervised/ Unsupervised) for the provided data set. You can
        :discuss the pros and cons of both approaches based on your understanding. Make a set of
        independent and dependent variables based on your objectives for ML tasks. (0-20 marks)

        2. Machine Learning models can be used for Prediction, Classification, and Clustering. You can choose
        suitable features for the machine learning models based on feature selection methods, such as
        random forest or any other method. The selection of hyperparameters for the ML models should be
        performed by using hyperparameter tuning, such as GridSearchCV. Obtain the best accuracy using
        optimal values of the hyperparameters. (0-30 marks)
        3. You should train and test the Machine learning models in the case of supervised learning for
        different splits (at least 2 splits) and use appropriate metrics for unsupervised learning. Use k-fold
        (10 or 20 or 30) cross-validation to provide authenticity of the modelling outcomes. (0-30 marks)
        4. Exhibit a comparison of ML modelling outcomes using a Table or graphical visualisation. Identify the
        possible similarities and contrasts in the Machine Learning modelling outcomes based on chosen
        performance metric and discuss their statistical implications. (0-20 marks)
