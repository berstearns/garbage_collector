# Step 1: Understand the Assignment Requirements
    Read the Assignment Instructions Carefully:

    Identify the key tasks: data preparation, EDA, encoding, scaling, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction.

    Understand the grading criteria for each section.

    Review the Dataset:

    Familiarize yourself with the dataset structure, column names, data types, and possible values.

    Note the target variables for classification (Rider Satisfaction) and regression (Bike Rental Cost).

# Step 2: Data Preparation
    Load the Dataset:

    Use Python libraries like Pandas to load the dataset.

    Check the dataset's size, attributes, and observations.

    Inspect the Dataset:

    Check for missing values using .isnull().sum().

    Identify duplicate rows using .duplicated().sum().

    Examine the data types of each column using .dtypes.

    Handle Missing Values:

    Decide on a strategy (e.g., imputation with mean/median/mode or removal of rows/columns).

    Justify your choice in your report.

    Describe the Dataset:

    Provide a summary of the dataset's characteristics (size, attributes, observations, and missing values).

    Use .describe() for numeric columns and .value_counts() for categorical columns.

# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Univariate Analysis:

    Analyze individual features:

    For numeric features (e.g., Rider Age, Ride Duration, Distance Covered, Bike Rental Cost), use histograms, boxplots, and summary statistics.

    For categorical features (e.g., City, Weather Condition, Bike Model, Rider Satisfaction), use bar plots and frequency tables.

    Bivariate Analysis:

    Explore relationships between features:

    Use scatter plots for numeric vs. numeric features (e.g., Ride Duration vs. Distance Covered).

    Use bar plots or grouped bar plots for categorical vs. categorical features (e.g., City vs. Rider Satisfaction).

    Use boxplots for numeric vs. categorical features (e.g., Rider Age vs. Rider Satisfaction).

    Correlation Analysis:

    Compute the correlation matrix for numeric features using .corr().

    Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap (e.g., with Seaborn).

    Justify EDA Techniques:

    Explain why you chose specific visualizations and statistical methods for each analysis.

# Step 4: Encoding, Scaling, and Feature Engineering
    Encoding Categorical Variables:

    Use one-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical features (e.g., City, Weather Condition, Bike Model).

    Justify your choice of encoding method.

    Scaling Numeric Features:

    Use standardization (StandardScaler) or normalization (MinMaxScaler) for numeric features (e.g., Rider Age, Ride Duration, Distance Covered).

    Justify your choice of scaling method.

    Feature Engineering:

    Create new features if necessary (e.g., "Ride Speed" = Distance Covered / Ride Duration).

    Drop irrelevant or redundant features (e.g., if a feature is highly correlated with another).

    Justify Techniques:

    Provide a detailed rationale for each encoding, scaling, and feature engineering step.

# Step 5: Dimensionality Reduction (LDA & PCA)
    Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):

    Apply LDA to reduce dimensionality while maximizing class separability (for Rider Satisfaction).

    Visualize the reduced data using a scatter plot.

    Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

    Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.

    Visualize the explained variance ratio and the reduced data.

    Compare LDA and PCA:

    Discuss the differences between LDA and PCA in terms of their objectives, assumptions, and results.

    Provide visualizations (e.g., scatter plots) to compare the reduced datasets.

    Justify Techniques:

    Explain why you chose LDA or PCA for this dataset and how the reduced dimensions affect the analysis.

# Step 6: Documentation and Reporting
    Write a Clear and Structured Report:

    Divide your report into sections corresponding to the steps above.

    Include code snippets, visualizations, and explanations for each step.

    Use Visualizations Effectively:

    Ensure all plots are labeled, titled, and properly formatted.

    Use visualizations to support your analysis and conclusions.

    Justify Your Choices:

    Provide a rationale for every method, technique, and decision you make.

    Conclude with Insights:

    Summarize your findings and provide actionable insights for the company (e.g., bike fleet management, pricing adjustments, customer satisfaction improvements).

# Step 7: Review and Refine
    Check for Errors:

    Ensure there are no missing values, incorrect data types, or logical errors in your analysis.

    Optimize Code:

    Make sure your code is clean, efficient, and well-commented.

    Proofread Your Report:

    Ensure your report is free of grammatical errors and clearly communicates your analysis.

    By following this step-by-step guide, you will address all the grading criteria and deliver a high-quality assignment. Focus on clarity, justification, and effective use of visualizations to maximize your grade.
