1. Load the dataset Q1.csv. It contains the exam scores (in percentages) of a sample of 50 students
from a Dublin secondary school.
    a. Find and comment on important summary statistics and produce an appropriate plot to
    summarise the dataset.
    b. One of the teachers is concerned about the performance of the students in the school. She
    suspects that their performance may be below the reported national average of 70%. Does
    the data show that her concerns are justified? Use a significance level of alpha = 0.05.
    c. Produce and comment on an appropriate plot to illustrate your findings.
