2. Load the diamonds dataset, and print the first 5 rows.
   The color variable refers to the colour of the diamond, with categories from “D” to “J”.
   Colourless diamonds are considered better than diamonds with a yellow tint.
   Diamonds from “D” to “F” are considered colourless, and diamonds from colour “G” to “J” are not considered colourless (that is, they have a very faint colour).
    a. Create a new binary variable in the dataframe called “colourless” which records 1 in rows
    with colourless diamonds and 0 otherwise.
    b. Perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine whether there is any association
    between the clarity of a diamond and whether it is colourless or not. Use a significance
    level of alpha = 0.01.
    c. Produce and comment on an appropriate plot to illustrate your findings.
    d. Find and interpret 90% confidence intervals for both the mean price of colourless diamonds
    and the mean price of non-colourless diamonds.
