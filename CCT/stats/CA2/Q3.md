3. Load the PlantGrowth dataset from the pydataset library.
    -It contains the results of a small study comparing the yields of plants obtained under a control and under two different treatment
conditions.
    - a. Find and comment on important summary statistics by treatment and produce an appropriate plot to summarise the dataset.
    - b. Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test to see if there is evidence of a difference between the three means (that is, the control and the two treatments). Use a significance level of alpha = 0.05.
    - c. If there is evidence of a difference between the three means, find and comment on where this difference may be.
