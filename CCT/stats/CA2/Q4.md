4. Load the trees dataset from the pydataset library.
   It contains measurements of the diameter, height and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees.
   Note that the diameter (in inches) is labelled girth in the dataset.
   It is measured at 4 foot 6 inches above the ground.
   -  a. Perform a correlation analysis between all numerical variables. Include and comment on the results of hypothesis tests for the population correlation coefficients between all three pairs of variables (you can use the pearsonr function from the scipy.stats library).
    - b. There is interest in estimating the volume of timber from trees using either the girth or the
height of the trees, or both. Perform a regression analysis to decide which of the three possible models you would recommend using. Interpret your results and provide a short conclusion of your findings.
