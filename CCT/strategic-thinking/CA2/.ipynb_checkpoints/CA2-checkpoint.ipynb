      "The Estonian DPA (Andmekaitse Inspektsioon) fined three online pharmacies EUR 100,000 each for processing personal data without the consent of the data subjects. The data in question are prescriptions for medicines of the data subjects. Third parties were able to view another person's current prescriptions in the e-pharmacy environment without their consent, based only on access to their personal identification code. The DPA highlighted that while it must be possible to purchase prescription drugs for other people, it is the responsibility of the company to ensure that the processing of the personal data required for this purpose only takes place with the consent of the data subjects. The confirmation of another person that they may access the data, however, does not correspond to the voluntary consent of the prescription holder, since the e-pharmacy cannot check whether and for what purpose the consent was given and whether it was given voluntarily.    6\n",

The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principle of data minimization. The original fine of EUR 1,500 was reduced to EUR 900 due to voluntary payment and admission of responsibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
      "The Italian DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 500,000 on Vodafone Italia S.p.A.. A customer had filed a complaint with the DPA against Vodafone. The 80-year-old customer had been contacted by an external call center commissioned by Vodafone. During the conversation, the call center concluded a new contract with the customer without their consent. During its investigation, the DPA also found that the customer had not received sufficient information about the processing of her personal data. In addition, the call center had read out the information too quickly, making the content incomprehensible. \\n\\nIn calculating the fine, the DPA took into account, as an aggravating factor, that Vodafone had already committed similar violations in the past. However, the fact that Vodafone immediately terminated the contract in question was taken into account as a mitigating factor.                                                                                             1\n",

As a result, patient medical records were accessible to any employee, whether or not the affected patient had consented to it.\\n\\nThe DPA considered this a violation of the obligation to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

Furthermore, Garante determined that the processing of biometric data had taken place without sufficiently informing the data subjects about the processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
