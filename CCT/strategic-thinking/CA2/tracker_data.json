The DPA's investigation revealed that Uber had stored sensitive personal data—such as location information, payment details, identity documents, and health data—on US servers without adequate safeguards for over two years. Since the European Court of Justice declared the EU-US Privacy Shield invalid, the transfer of personal data to the USA is only permitted under certain conditions that must ensure a level of protection for personal data that is equivalent to the level of protection within the EU. However, Uber had not used sufficient safeguards such as the so-called 'standard contractual clauses' since August 2021, which meant that the personal data of drivers from the EU was inadequately protected. Only at the end of 2023 did Uber begin to apply the successor to the Privacy Shield, the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, to secure the transfer of data to the USA.",

However, the controller did not respond to the incident, arguing that the order was in their husband's name. However, the DPA found that the controller should have complied with the request and that the controller had failed to install appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data in order to avoid such an incident.",

The DPA initiated an investigation against the controller due to 107 notifications and 8 complaints from data subjects regarding undesired marketing calls. It found that the controller had repeatedly called data subjects without their consent or registration in the national opt-out register. The DPA also found that a large number of the contracts concluded resulted from the illegal calls. The high number of unauthorized advertising calls was mainly due to the controller's lack of control over its contracted advertising agencies.",

These signs must be visible to individuals at the latest when entering the surveillance perimeter. Furthermore, according to Paragraph 2 of the same article, the signs must contain all relevant information as stipulated in Art. 13 GDPR.

Overall, however, it considered the extensive storage of all these data and statistical indicators to be disproportionate.\n\nThe CNIL also found a breach of the information and transparency obligation under the GDPR, as employees and external visitors were not adequately informed about the systems. Finally, the CNIL found that the video surveillance software was not sufficiently secured.",

        "summary": "The Croatian DPA (AZOP) has imposed of fine of EUR 15,000 to a hotel. The hotel was collecting personal data from guests in excess of what would have been necessary for the purpose of booking a hotel room and without a valid legal basis. Specifically, the hotel collected the CVC number of guests' credit cards and copies of their identification documents. The hotel also failed to provide clear and transparent information to guests on the collection and use of their data.\n \nThe hotel claimed it collected the CVC numbers of credit cards and even copies of personal identification document, when the booking was made via email, in order to prevent misuse of the credit cards. The booking was possible via third party platforms and the hotel’s email and web form. The booking via email and web form enables solely booking, but not payment. Regardless of this, the hotel still requested provision of financial data (information on the credit card and CVC number). Taking into consideration that the booking was possible without provision of the CVC number, AZOP found that hotel did not have a legal basis for processing of such data.\n \nThe hotel also failed to provide clear and transparent information to guests on the collection and use of their data. Neither the hotel's general terms and conditions nor the form of consent for use of personal data provided sufficient information on circumstances of processing. In addition, the hotel did not undertake adequate technical and organisational measures, e.g. encryption of data. \n \nFinally, by appointing the hotel manager as the data protection officer, the controller violated the provisions of Art. 38 (6) GDPR. Although the data protection officer may also perform other tasks and duties, the controller must ensure that such tasks and duties do not lead to a conflict of interest. Accordingly, the controller should have been aware that there is a conflict of interest in relation to the tasks and duties that the hotel manager performs. It is clear from the job description of the hotel manager that they are largely responsible for making management decisions concerning personal data processing, while on the other hand, as the data protection officer, they are obliged to monitor the compliance of the business with the regulations governing the protection of personal data.",

The DPA had received a complaint from a citizen concerning Zagreb Holding's practice of requesting a copy of users' personal identification cards before issuing invoices via email. Previously, to receive invoice by email the users only needed to provide their name, surname, address, personal identification number, facility number and their user number. \n \nDuring the investigation, it was found that Zagreb Holding lacked established rules for identifying service users requesting invoice copies via email and only collected copies of identification documents when there was suspicion of false representation. The company requested personal identification document copies from users whose email addresses had a different name/ structure than their name and surname, or if the user's name and surname in the email address did not match the requested invoice copy email address's structure. The DPA found that the mere inclusion of the correct name and surname in an email address is an insufficient protective measure. Consequently, the data controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures for user identification, contrary to Art. 25 (2) GDPR. According to the explanation given by the DPA, the data controller should have developed a process for identification via email ensuring a uniform procedure for all users, regardless of the email address structure.\nFurthermore, the data controller failed to transparently inform service users about the legal basis for collecting personal data (scan of personal identification card) for identification purposes. Such information were not available on the company's official website nor provided upon direct request via email.",

The company had used Google Analytics for visitor statistics and based the data processing by the statistics tool on the EU standard contractual clauses in the absence of an EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. In the course of its investigation, the DPA determined that the use of the standard contractual clauses was not sufficient to guarantee a level of protection equivalent to that of the EU.",

They had also been asked broad questions that led to the disclosure of sensitive private information. The data was collected to determine whether a settlement could be pursued with the plaintiff.\n\nThe DPC concluded that the collection of information about the social services provided was lawful. However, the questions that led to the disclosure of the sensitive information were excessive and, according to the DPC, not necessary for the purposes of the litigation. According to the DPC, this violated the principle of data minimization.",

The customer had submitted an application for a credit card to the bank, which was rejected in the course of an automated decision, despite the customer's good credit history and high income. The customer then requested an explanation of the reasons for the rejection of their application and the basis on which the automated decision was made. However, the controller refused to provide such information to him, which also made it difficult for the customer to appeal the decision. The DPA found that the controller violated its obligation to transparently inform the data subject about the decision upon request.",

AZOP had received a complaint from a data subject, stating that the controller had obtained a copy of their bank card. \n\nDuring its investigation, AZOP found that the controller had collected personal data (including copies of bank cards) of data subjects without a valid legal basis. In 2022, players had the option to have their winnings paid out not only via their bank account but also via their Visa card. The controller collected copies of the bank cards with the intention of complying with requirements of the national Money Laundering Act. However, AZOP found that the collection of the copies was not necessary to comply with the requirements of the Money Laundering Act and that the processing of the data was therefore unlawful.\n\nIn this context, AZOP also found that the controller had not sufficiently informed the data subjects about the processing of their personal data, in particular, it was expressly stated that the data controller does not store bank card numbers and that the numbers are not accessible to the unauthorized persons. Accordingly, the information provided to the data subjects was missing information on the legal basis, purpose of collection and retention period of the personal data. \n\nThe controller also failed to take sufficient technical and organizational measures to protect personal data relating to the establishment of payment processes via Visa bank cards, as well as for the storage of data contained in the controller's databases. \n\nAs a result, in 2022 the controller collected copies of a total of 2078 bank cards, of which 655 copies were fully accessible. \n\nIn assessing the fine amount, AZOP took into account as an aggravating factor that financial data is particularly sensitive data and the controller therefore should have taken special measures to protect it. \n\nAs a mitigating circumstance, it was taken into account that the controller had announced that it would bring its processing procedures in line with the GDPR and had deleted all secured copies of the bank cards.",

In its decision, the DPC found that Meta had violated Art. 46 GDPR by continuing to transfer personal data to the U.S. after the Schrems II ruling of the CJEU. According to the Schrems II ruling, U.S. law does not provide a level of protection for personal data substantially equivalent to that provided by EU law and that the standard contractual clauses (SCCs) also do not provide sufficient protection. Meta based its data transfers on the SCCs and additional own safeguards. However, during its investigation, the DPC determined that these additional measures did not compensate for the inadequate protections provided by U.S. law. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision to other concerned supervisory authorities pursuant to Art. 60 GDPR. In response, the DPC received objections from supervisory authorities, which led to a dispute resolution procedure before the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). In its decision, the EDPB asked the DPC to amend the proposed fine and adapt it to the seriousness of the data protection breach.\n\nThe DPC also ordered to cease any future transfer of personal data to the U.S., as well as to cease storage, within six months, of data already transferred to the U.S.\n\nMeta has announced that it will appeal the ruling and seek a suspension of the orders in court.",

AZOP had received an anonymous complaint in December 2022 stating that a large number of debtors' personal data had been processed by the collection agency without authorization. Attached to the complaint was a USB stick containing personal data (name, date of birth, personal identification number) of 77,317 debtors. \n\nDuring its investigation, AZOP found that controller did not provide sufficient information about the processing of personal data in its privacy policy. Moreover, it failed to provide information about the legal basis for the refund of overpaid funds. The breach affected 132,652 individuals. \n\nFurther, the AZOP found that the controller had not entered into a data processing agreement with a processor that monitored simple consumer bankruptcies. This put the data of 83,896 individuals at risk. The breach persisted for 2 years.\n\nFinally, AZOP found that the controller had failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. \nDeficiencies in the controller's security system led to insecure processing of personal data on a large scale, resulting in the unauthorized filtering of data. AZOP noted that the breach has been ongoing since at least 2019 and has not been addressed to date. \n\nAggravating factors considered by AZOP included the controller's failure to adequately cooperate with the DPA during the process. Furthermore, the controller has not yet informed AZOP of additional measures it has taken to prevent future risks of identified violations and has not yet brought its privacy policy into compliance with the GDPR.",

        "summary": "The Irish DPA (DPC) has fined WhatsApp Ireland Ltd. EUR 5.5 million. The Austrian organization 'None of Your Business' (NOYB) had filed a complaint with the DPA on behalf of an individual. \n\nWhatsApp had updated its terms of service shortly before the GDPR came into force. In its new terms of service, WhatsApp informed its users to click 'Agree and Continue' to indicate their agreement with the new terms of service. This was required for further access to the services. WhatsApp assumed that the acceptance of the updated terms of use constituted a contract between WhatsApp and the user, since the processing of the data would be necessary for the provision as well as the improvement of the services. According to WhatsApp, the data processing was therefore lawful pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant argued that WhatsApp was actually trying to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing users' data. By making the access to its services conditional on users' consent to the updated terms of service, WhatsApp was forcing users to consent to the processing of their personal data. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other European supervisory authorities concerned. The DPC found that WhatsApp did not rely on user consent as a legal basis, and did not consider 'coerced consent' in this case. It also did not rule out the possibility that WhatsApp relied on a contractual legal basis. In response, the DPC received objections from different supervisory authorities. However, the DPC found that WhatsApp had breached its transparency obligations under the GDPR, by not clearly explaining to users for what purpose and on what legal basis their personal data would be processed. \n\nAs no agreement could be reached on the disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR. In its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by WhatsApp. However, the EDPB took a different position than the DPC on the issue of the legal basis and found that WhatsApp was not entitled to rely on a contractual legal basis. The EDPB therefore found that WhatsApp had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required WhatsApp to bring its data processing into compliance within three months.\nThe DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required WhatsApp to bring its data processing into compliance within six months.",

The DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 210 million for violations related to the provision of its Facebook service and EUR 180 million for violations related to the provision of its Instagram service. The Austrian organization 'None of Your Business' (NOYB) had filed a complaint with the DPA on behalf of two individuals. \n\nMeta had updated its terms of service shortly before the GDPR came into force. In its new terms of service, Meta informed its users to click 'Agree and Continue' to indicate their agreement with the new terms of service. This was required for further access to the services. Meta assumed that the acceptance of the updated terms of use constituted a contract between Meta and the user, since the processing of the data would be necessary for the provision as well as the improvement of the services. According to Meta, the data processing was therefore lawful pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant argued that Meta was actually trying to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing users' data. By making the access to its services conditional on users' consent to the updated terms of service, Meta was actually forcing users to consent to the processing of their personal data. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other European supervisory authorities concerned. The DPC found that Meta did not rely on user consent as a legal basis, and did not consider 'coerced consent' in this case. It also did not rule out the possibility that Meta relied on a contractual legal basis. In response, the DPC received objections from different supervisory authorities. However, the DPC found that Meta had breached its transparency obligations under the GDPR, by not clearly explaining to users for what purpose and on what legal basis their personal data would be processed. \n\nAs no agreement could be reached on the disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR. In its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by Meta. However, the EDPB took a different position than the DPC on the issue of the legal basis and found that Meta was not entitled to rely on a contractual legal basis. The EDPB therefore found that Meta had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required Meta to bring its data processing into compliance within three months.",

The DPA found several violations of data protection law during its investigation. Firstly, the DPA found that, contrary to the specified information in the privacy policy, Techpump shared users' personal data with companies belonging to the same group. In addition, the DPA found that Techpump had not specified a retention period for users' personal data and kept it indefinitely until users requested to withdraw their consent. Techpump also processed users' personal data without first obtaining their consent. Further, the DPA found that Techpump did not have sufficient parental controls to prevent minors under the age of 14 from accessing its content. In addition, Techpump's privacy policy was only available in English, rather than Spanish, and the information was not clearly understandable. Techpump also required that individuals who wished to exercise their data subject rights submit their ID card information in order to verify their identity. The DPA considered this to be an unacceptable impediment to the exercise of data subject rights. Finally, Techpump also collected various data such as IP addresses and WIFI data without having defined a processing purpose for it.",

The siphoned data contained bank account information, social security numbers, ethnicity, sexual orientation and religion of the data subjects, among other things. \n\nThe DPA's investigation found that inadequate security measures allowed the attack to occur. \n\nInterservere employees, for example, had not been adequately trained on data privacy. \n\nIn addition, Interserve processed personal data on unsupported operating systems that were no longer subject to security updates to address vulnerabilities in the system. Also, Interserve had not conducted adequate vulnerability scans. Finally, Interserve's information security team had not sufficiently investigated the attack as antivirus software reported that the malware had been removed.",

Once customers purchased these products, Easlylife created a profile of them in order to target them with a health-related item. \n\nDuring its investigation, the DPA found that the company collected and used the personal data (health data) of a total of 145,500 data subjects without their consent or even knowledge. \n\nThe DPA found that this 'invisible' processing of the personal data constituted a serious violation of the data subjects' rights, as they were not able to exercise their privacy and data protection rights at all due to lack of knowledge of the processing. \n\nIn addition, the company had made 1,345,732 unsolicited marketing calls to individuals without their consent to the calls.

In addition, the CNIL found that due to technical problems, many individuals were unable to opt-out of receiving the promotional emails. \n\nIn this context, CNIL found that ACCOR had not sufficiently informed data subjects about the processing of their personal data in the context of promotional messages and thus violated Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR. \n\nFurther, ACCOR had failed to respond to data subjects' requests for access to personal data in a timely manner, and thus the CNIL found a violation of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 15 GDPR. \n\nThe company had also failed to comply with the data subjects' right to object due to the technical problems. The CNIL therefore found a violation of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 21 GDPR. \n\nFinally, the CNIL found a violation of Art. 32 GDPR because ACCOR allowed the use of passwords that were not sufficiently secure. \n\nIn imposing the fine, CNIL considered aggravatingly that the violations affected several fundamental principles of personal data protection and constituted a fundamental infringement of the rights of the data subjects, as well as the number of data subjects involved.",

Individuals' profiles can be enriched with information associated with those images, such as image tags and geolocation. In the course of its investigation the DPA found that the personal data contained in the company's database had been processed unlawfully and without a valid legal basis. Also, the DPA found that the company had not provided the data subject with access to their personal data and thus violating Art. 15 GDPR. Furthermore, Cleaview had violated the principle of transparency by failing to adequately inform users about the processing of their data.",

The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust is a mental health specialist trust located in London.\n\nIn early September 2019, the trust wanted to run a contest asking patients at the adult gender identity clinic to provide artwork to decorate a renovated clinic building. For this, two emails were inadvertently sent with an open distribution list (one to 912 recipients and the second to 869 recipients).\n\nIt was clear from the content of the email that all recipients were patients of the clinic. The trust immediately recognized the error and unsuccessfully attempted to recall the emails. \n\nAs part of its investigation, the IOC determined that the trust had no technical or organizational measures in place to prevent or mitigate this highly predictable human error. The ICO rated the harm to affected individuals as high given that information about the affected individuals' relationship with a gender identity clinic is very sensitive personal information. \n\n\nDue to immediate implementation of security measures and extensive cooperation with the ICO, the fine was reduced from EUR 910,000 to EUR 91,00.",

According to the DPA, this constitutes a significant impediment and deterrent to the exercise of such rights.\n\nIn addition, the DPA found that the company had violated several principles of the GDPR. For example, the company had violated the principle of transparency by failing to adequately inform users about the processing of their data. Clearview had also violated violated the principle of storage limitation by not providing a data retention policy and thus not being able to ensure that personal data is not held for longer than necessary.

Two data subjects had complained to the DPA that Google had disclosed their personal data to third parties without authorization. \n\nIn the course of the lengthy investigation, the DPA found that Google had passed on personal data of data subjects to the so-called Lumen project. \n\nLumen is a project run by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. The project began in 2002 for the purpose of collecting requests relating to the removal of content from websites within and outside of the United States. This data may then be accessed by researchers and other interested parties. \n\nUsers of Google-operated platforms such as YouTube or Google Drive have the option of requesting that content about themselves on the platforms be removed. For this purpose, Google has provided various contact and complaint forms.\n\nHowever, the data of the data subjects who use these forms was automatically transmitted to the Lumen project. \nThe data subjects did not have the opportunity to object to this transmission, because the automatic transmission to Lumen was a condition for using the forms. \nFor this reason, the DPA found that, due to the lack of possibility to object to the transfer of the data to Lumen, Google processed the data subjects' data without a valid legal basis. \n\nIn this context, the DPA also found that Google did not sufficiently enable data subjects to exercise their right to erasure of their data. \n\nWhen assessing the fine, the DPA took into account as aggravating factors that the data was not only disclosed, but also transferred to a third country without giving the data subjects the possibility to object to it. This deprived the data subjects of control over the handling of their personal data. In addition, the DPA found that the transfer took place over a very long period of time. \nAlso, a large number of individuals were affected and in some cases sensitive data was processed.",

The student system processed, among other things, personal data of minor students such as teacher feedback and information about students' private affairs. \nDuring its investigation, the DPA found that the purpose of the processing of the children's data had not been sufficiently clearly defined. In this context, the DPA also found a breach of the principle of proportionality and data minimization. In addition, the DPA concluded that the city had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures regarding the protection of personal data. This would have been necessary given the high risk that the data might be transferred to and processed in the United States. \nIn determining the fine, mitigating consideration was given to the fact that no damage was caused by the data breaches.",

The daycare center had written the e-mail to prevent rumors about the teacher's absence ( e.g. a covid illness) and to protect her. However, the educator had not consented to the disclosure of her pregnancy status. The DPA therefore found that Educationest had unlawfully processed the educator's data and violated Art. 5 GDPR and Art. 6 GDPR.",

        "summary": "The Dutch DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 3,7 million on the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. This is the highest fine ever imposed by the Dutch DPA\n\nAs part of its investigation, the DPA found a number of violations of the GDPR. \n\nThe Tax and Customs Administration had kept a list for several years on which it recorded indications of fraud. The list contained information on over 270,000 individuals, including minors. The administration had processed personal data such as health, citizenship, and criminal personal data as part of the list maintenance.\n\nThe DPA initially found that the administration did not have a valid legal basis for processing the data contained in the list. For this reason, the data were processed unlawfully. \n\nFurther, the DPA found that the information in the list was often incorrect, so that a large number of individuals were falsely registered as possible fraudsters. \n\nIn addition, the investigation revealed that the maintenance of the list led to discrimination against some individuals, as the risk of fraud was determined on the basis of the nationality and appearance of the data subjects, among other factors. For example, donations to mosques were considered a risk factor for fraud. \n\nFurthermore, the DPA found that the administration violated its obligation under the GDPR to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that ensure adequate protection of the personal data it collects. Indeed, the administration had inadequately secured the personal data. \n\nThe DPA also found that the administration had violated the principle of storage limitation by storing the data for a longer time contrary to the retention period established for the personal data in the list.\n\nFurthermore, the DPA found that the processing of the data in the list had not been necessary for the administration to properly perform its tasks. The processing was therefore disproportionate. Also, the administration had not sufficiently defined the purposes underlying the processing and thus violated the principle of purpose limitation. \n\nThe fine is composed as follows: \n\nEUR 1 million for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR;\nEUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR;\nEUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) d) GDPR;\nEUR 250,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR;\nEUR 500,000 for a breach of Art. 32 (1) GDPR\nEUR 450,000 for a breach of Art. 35 (2) GDPR.",

The data subject requested a copy of its personal data, i.e. a copy of the video surveillance footage relating to a specific time and area. The energy company justified rejecting the request by: (i) lack of written request by competent authorities to deliver the footage, (ii) lack of justified purpose for the request, and (iii) claiming that providing a copy of the footage would adversely affect rights and freedoms of the station’s personnel and other customers. Following issuance of the DPA’s general opinion to the customer on the obligation of the controllers to provide surveillance footage to the data subjects filmed on such footage, the energy company informed the customer on the inability to provide the footage as the video surveillance footage archives are being erased after seven days. Due to the violation of fundamental rights of the data subject the DPA imposed a fine of HRK 940,000.00. The clarification on the fine amount notes that the DPA has taken into consideration not only the indirect damages to the customer, but also the potential financial gains of the company that has indirectly avoided damages that could have arisen in the course of a consumer dispute and the fact that by deleting the footage, the company has eliminated potentially important evidence.",

        "summary": "A retail company, i.e. the data controller, reported the breach of personal data to the DPA informing that its employees have recorded video surveillance footage via mobile phone which was unauthorised and contrary to the company’s internal acts and instructions. The recording was made public by leaking to social media and consequently other media outlets. The DPA determined that the data controller did not take adequate actions to prevent its employees from creating the footage. Although the company did undertake certain measures such as adopting internal acts on access to video surveillance footage, educating employees and implementing confidentiality statements, the DPA determined the company did not ensure – neither before nor after the disclosure of the unauthorised footage – appropriate organisational and technical security measures for the purpose of minimising risk of such or similar data breaches. In addition, the data controller did not regularly monitor or inspect efficiency of the technical and organisational measures implemented for the purpose of maintaining confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data. Thus, the DPA imposed a fine of HRK 675,000.00 for the failure to take appropriate technical measures and clarified that this fine should also have general preventive effects and raise awareness among the data controllers and processor on the obligations concerning data processing.",

BREBAU GmbH also deliberately ignored requests from data subjects for transparency about the processing of their data. \n\nIn imposing the fine, the DPA took into account, as an aggravating factor, the extraordinary depth of the violation of the fundamental right to data protection. \n\nHowever, because BREBAU GmbH cooperated fully during the investigation, made efforts to mitigate the damage, clarified the facts on its own and ensured that such violations would not be repeated, the amount of the fine could be reduced.",

Despite this knowledge, the Ministry did not adjust the security measures in time. For this reason, the DPA finds that the Ministry acted with gross negligence. \n\nThe DPA also found that the Foreign Ministry did not adequately inform individuals who applied for visas that their personal information would be shared with other parties.",

The bank operated the application to prevent complaints and to keep customers.\n\nThe bank did not inform the data subjects, that the processing of their data serves, among other things, for customer retention purposes, meaning that customers were not in a position to object to the processing. As a result, the rights of the data subjects regarding adequate information and the right to object were not guaranteed.\n\nThe DPA also found that the bank's legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing the personal data was not sufficiently substantiated as the bank had not sufficiently examined the interests of the data subjects.

In the context of this complaint, the compliance of the 'Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF)' with the GDPR was mainly questioned. The TCF was developed by IAB to promote compliance with the GDPR by organizations using the OpenRTB protocol. \n\nThe OpenRTB protocol is a protocol for 'real-time bidding,' which is the automated online auction of user profiles for the sale and purchase of advertising space on the Internet. When users visit a website that contains an ad space, technology companies, through an automated auction system, can bid in real time for that ad space to display personalized advertising. \n\nWhen users visit a website for the first time, an interface appears through which they can consent to the collection and sharing of their personal information or object to various types of processing. \n\nAs part of the TCF, a consent management tool appears during this process. The tool allows the user to object to certain types of data processing. The TCF registers the user's preferences through the tool by generating a TC string and sends it to all partners participating in the OpenRTB system. Based on this TC string, user profiles are compiled, which are then passed on to advertisers. This makes it visible to them what kind of data processing the users have agreed to. \n\nWithin the scope of its investigation against IAB, the DPA identified a number of violations of the GDPR.\n\nIt found that the TC strings already constituted personal data and therefore IAB was required to have a legal basis for processing these data. However, IAB was unable to demonstrate any such legal basis.\n\nIn addition, IAB did not properly inform users about the functioning of the TCF. For example, the information provided to users was too generic and vague to understand the scope of the data processing. \n\nFurthermore, IAB had not maintained a register of its processing activities, had not appointed a data protection officer, as well as had not conducted a data protection impact assessment.",

The notices contained, among other things, sensitive data of the demonstrators and organizers of the demonstrations. The data revealed, among other things, the political opinion , religious or philosophical beliefs or sexual orientation of the data subjects. The DPA found that the transfer of the data would not have been necessary for the entities to properly perform their public tasks. Thus, the processing took place without a sufficient legal basis. In addition, the DPA found that the municipality had carried out the processing without informing the data subjects, without establishing a policy for the retention of their personal data, and without conducting a data protection impact assessment.",

The DPA found, among other things, that data subjects received unsolicited promotional calls in the name of and on behalf of Enel Energia, in some cases even recorded calls. Some of the data subjects still received advertising calls, even though they had already requested Enel Energia to delete their personal data several times or had objected to their processing for advertising purposes. In particular, the DPA found that Enel Energia had not provided data subjects with the required and timely feedback on their requests to exercise their rights of access and opposition. In addition, the DPA found that the company had not sufficiently cooperated with the DPA during the investigation. For example, Enel Energia failed to respond to various inquiries from the DPA. In assessing the fine, the DPA considered the following factors aggravating: the seriousness of the violations, the duration and repetition of the violations, as well as the large number of persons affected and the negligence of the conduct. Update: The Court of Rome overturned the fine of EUR 26.5 million.",

        "summary": "The Norwegian DPA has fined Grindr LLC EUR 6.3 million. Grindr is a location-based social networking app designed for gay, bi, trans and queer people.  In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority filed a complaint against Grindr with the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the portal had shared information about users' GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender with several third parties for marketing purposes. \n\nUnder GDPR, consent is required for the sharing of this personal data. However, during its investigation, the DPA found that the consent collected by Grindr was not valid. \n\nUsers had to accept the privacy policy in order to use the app, but were not explicitly asked whether they would consent to their data being shared with third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the information about the disclosure of personal data was not clear or accessible enough for users. \n\n\nThe DPA points out that this type of data may identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. Grindr users would sometimes want to use the app anonymously without, for example, giving their full name or uploading a photo of themselves. With the sexual orientation of the users, a special category of personal data, which is subject to a particularly high level of protection, was therefore also affected. \n\nThe DPA therefore considers the infringement to be a particularly serious case that justifies a deterrent high fine. Business models based on behavior-based marketing are widespread in the digital economy, making it important that the fines for GDPR violations are deterrent.",

However, the fine was issued due to GDPR violations. \n\nThe DPA found that the Council violated Art. 13 GDPR in relation to the processing of data by traffic cameras. The Council had failed to provide information on the identity of the data controller, the contact details of the data protection officer, the purposes of the processing and the bodies from which further information required under Art. 13 GDPR may be obtained.  In addition, the Council failed to provide this information in an easily accessible manner such as on signs near the cameras.\n\nFurther, the DPA concluded that the Council failed to post a video surveillance policy in an clear and plain language as well as in an easily accessible area of the Council's website. The DPA thus found an infringement of Art. 12 GDPR. \n\nLastly, the Council has denied requests for access to personal data processed by surveillance cameras used in traffic management. For this reason, the DPA found that the Council violated Art. 15 GDPR.",

An unauthorized third party had gained access to Vastaamo's medical database on at least two occasions, in December 2018 and March 2019. The attacker had also siphoned off data and left a ransom note on the servers. Due to insufficient logging, neither the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses used by the attacker could be identified.\n\nThe most likely cause of the medical database leak was an unprotected port on the database where the root user account of the database was not password protected. The patient database server was open to the Internet without firewall protection during the period between November 26, 2017, and March 13, 2019.\n\nFor this reason, the DPA determined that the personal data were not adequately protected against unauthorized and unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction, or damage, and that the controller had not implemented basic measures for the secure processing of personal data.\n\nAs part of its investigation, the DPA also determined that the controller must have known as early as March 2019 that data in the patient information system had been lost and could have been compromised by an external attacker. Vastaamo should have immediately reported the security breach to both the DPA and its patients. However, Vastaamo was significantly late in meeting this obligation. \n\nThe fine is composed proportionately of EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 33 (1) GDPR, EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 34 (1) GDPR and EUR 316, 800 for the breach of Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR.",

The DPA conducted the investigation on its own initiative after information about a possible personal data breach (Art. 33 GDPR) of the company's customers became public in February 2021. According to the company, they learned about the security breach from another cybersecurity service provider who informed them that the customer data of 110,302 CityBee users had been published on the website of the hacking forum RaidForums.com. This included data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, personal identification numbers, driver's license numbers, type of payment card and the last four digits of the card number of the data subjects. \n\nThe DPA's investigation revealed that the published data originated from an unsecured backup copy of a database. \n\nThe DPA found that the data breach occurred due to the company's failure to comply with its obligation to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to data subjects. \n\nThe company had, for example, failed to appoint a person with appropriate competence to be responsible for security and risk management.  It had also failed to ensure that accesses to database files were logged and evaluated. \nIn addition, the company had stored the database unencrypted, so that a person with technical knowledge could have had full access to the data in the file after downloading it. The personal codes in the database were furthermore stored unprotected and the passwords in the database were only encrypted with an encryption algorithm that was considered insecure.",

Nevertheless, as of May 2018, the dual citizenship data of a total of 1,4 million people were still registered in the systems of the tax and customs administration.\n\nThe DPA therefore found that the data had been unlawfully processed due to the lack of a valid legal basis.

A data subject had filed a complaint against the data controller due to the fact that telephone lines were registered in his name, although he had never concluded contracts with the company for any of these lines. Vodafone had accidentally assigned the data of the data subject to the contracts of another Vodafone customer, which is why the contracts went under his name. Against this background, the DPA considered the processing of the data subject's data by Vodafone to be unlawful. The original fine of EUR 50,000 was reduced to EUR 40,000 due to voluntary payment.",

In 367 cases, the data included medical information of people who had requested, for example, wheelchair transportation or additional services because they were blind or deaf. The DPA noted that a lack of security measures allowed the hacker to access the systems. Thus, it was possible to access the airline's systems simply by entering the password. The systems did not incorporate multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, the access rights of the accounts were not limited to necessary systems, allowing the hacker to use them to gain access to multiple Transavia systems.

In May 2020, a trade union filed a complaint with the CNIL alleging that the number of strike days exercised by staff were included in files used to prepare promotion decisions. The CNIL then conducted investigations in several RATP bus centers. These led to confirmation of this practice in three RATP bus centers. The CNIL indicated that files for evaluating performance and promotion prospects should only contain data necessary for evaluating employees.In particular, it was sufficient to indicate the total number of days of absence without the need to go into detail and distinguish the days associated with the exercise of the right to strike. It found that the use of data on the number of days staff members were on strike was not necessary for these purposes, and that the RATP thus violated the principle of data minimization set forth in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the RATP had excessively retained many of its employees' data. Indeed, the RATP kept files on the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission, although their retention was only required for 18 months after the holding of these commissions. Further, CNIL found that RATP did not adequately differentiate between staff authorization levels, allowing more staff than necessary to access certain data. For this reason, CNIL concluded that RATP failed in its duty to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.",

Participants uploaded their own drawings to an online platform along with entry forms containing their personal data and that of their parents, including their consent. In order to vote for the best drawing, the children's drawings were posted on the online platform and by accident along with it  the personal data included in the participation forms.\nAt the time of the investigation, it was determined that the security incident had resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of personal data of IKEA Family members (surname, first name and age of minors, as well as surname, first name, city, country, email, IKEA Family membership number and the signature of the parents) on the online platform accessible only to IKEA Family members in Romania. The incident affected 114 people, half of whom were minors. \nThe DPA found that the controller had thus breached its obligation under Art. 32 (1) b), (2) GDPR to implement technical and organizational measures that ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk for the data subjects.",

On this basis, the DPA initiated an investigation into whether Ferde has implemented routines and measures to ensure adequate information security for the information transferred to China.\n\nAs part of its operations, Ferde is responsible for registering passages at toll booths. The registration is usually done by a chip in the car. If the chip in the car is not properly registered or the car does not have a chip, a photo of the car's license plate is taken.\n\nThese images are then sent to an automatic optical character recognition system to digitally read the license plate. In cases where the image quality is not good enough for automatic interpretation, the image is transmitted for manual processing. Ferde contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS), which also has employees in China, for this task. \n\nAfter its investigations, the DPA concluded that Ferde AS had violated a number of basic obligations of the GDPR for a period of 1-2 years. \n\nFor one thing, Ferde had not conducted a risk assessment before processing personal data and before using manual image processing by the processor. However, this would have been necessary to assess the risks associated with the transfer and to determine whether further security measures may be required. \n\nIn addition, the DPA found that Ferde had not entered into a proper processor contract regarding the processing of UBS.As a result, the transfer of the personal data in question to China took place without a valid legal basis. \nIn determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that a large amount of personal data was affected by the violation. On the other hand, the fact that no material or immaterial damage to the affected parties could be proven had a mitigating effect.",

The special contracts served to attract new customers and were accompanied by bonus payments for the customers. The controller compared personal data of prospective customers who had submitted an inquiry for a special contract with contracts concluded by existing customers. If this revealed that an applicant had already signed a contract with the controller, then switched to another supplier and now wanted to sign a contract again, the controller could reject the application for the special contract if necessary. This was intended to prevent 'bonus shopping', which is not lucrative for the companies. However, the controller had not properly informed the customers that such comparisons would be made.

Thus, data subjects would have had the opportunity to contact the company that collected the data and object to the processing.

Contrary to Sky Italia's view, the consent to the disclosure of data to third parties given by the data subjects to the companies from which Sky Italia had acquired the lists did not authorize Sky Italia to use the data for its own promotional purposes.\nIn addition, Sky failed to verify the list of individuals who had objected to being contacted for advertising purposes before making the advertising calls. As a result, several data subjects had received advertising calls despite their explicit objection. Further, the DPA found that Sky had failed to properly appoint the suppliers of the lists as data processors. \nIn determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into aggravating consideration that the violations involved 'systemic' conduct that was rooted in the company's operations as well as the fact that Sky should have acquired sufficient experience and competence to make fundamental decisions in compliance with data protection regulations due to its ongoing contacts with the authority and its long-standing presence in the market.",

In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States; instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the  pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. \nEventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR.",

        "summary": "The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 5,000 on the Ciechi Ardizzone Gioeni di Catania residential home for blind people. A visitor to the residence filed a complaint with the DPA. He based this on an installed video surveillance system in the accommodation. The video surveillance system recorded, among other things, the corridor connecting the accommodation with the communal showers. Moreover, the footage was not only recorded but also displayed in real time on the monitors of the concierge staff, creating the risk that the images could also be inadvertently seen by visitors or suppliers. During the course of the investigation, the institution's administration justified the installation of the video surveillance system by citing the need to prevent theft and ensure the health of residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic period. \n\nThe DPA found that the institute thereby violated the principles of lawfulness, transparency and data minimization. The fact that, as claimed by the institute, the passage of the guests to the shower rooms was filmed only occasionally and for a short duration, and that the quality of the recordings was not 'perfectly clear,' does not resolve the unlawfulness of the recordings. Also, the DPA noted that some procedural precautions - such as scheduling time windows to turn off the cameras to allow guests to visit the shower rooms without being filmed, or temporarily ensuring the security of the locations through alternative measures, such as the use of security personnel - may allow the institute to pursue the purpose of the video surveillance in an equally effective manner and avoid unjustifiably restricting the freedoms of the data subjects.\n\nFurthermore, the DPA found that the institute had not properly fulfilled its duty to inform. The institute had only provided the data subjects with detailed information about the video surveillance system on the bulletin board after the investigation had begun. However, this type of information is not suitable for visually impaired people. The institute should have provided the residents with a pre-recorded audio message that could be played back if necessary.",

The controller had argued during the DPA's investigation that consent for others to contact her could be inferred from the fact that she had a public profile. However, the DPA noted that the exchange of information via a social network should only allow for what is specified in the relevant terms of use. The DPA clarified that the platform is intended to enable the exchange of contact information in order to make job offers. In contrast, it is not intended that users use the platform to send messages to other users in order to sell services. Moreover, it is irrelevant whether a user profile is public or not.

        "summary": "The Irish DPA (DPC) has imposed a fine of EUR 225,000,000 on WhatsApp Ireland Ltd. The DPA had started extensive investigations into the messaging service's compliance with transparency obligations back in December 2018. In this context, the DPC investigated whether WhatsApp complied with its obligations under the GDPR regarding the provision of information and the transparency of this information to users and non-users of WhatsApp. \n\nIn the course of the investigation, the DPC found that WhatsApp had committed serious violations of Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR with respect to the information provided to users. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other affected European supervisory authorities in December 2020. The DPC subsequently received objections from eight supervisory authorities. Due to lack of agreement, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR on June 3, 2021. \n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPB), by its decision of July 28, 2021, then, required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine based on a number of factors. The EDPS found a violation of the principle of transparency set forth in Article 5(1) a) of the GDPR in addition to the violations found by the DPC, and requested this to be reflected in the final amount of the fine. \n\nBased on this, the DPC imposed the fine in the amount of EUR 225,000,000. \n\nThe fine is composed as follows:\n\nEUR 90,000,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR;\nEUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 12 GDPR;\nEUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR; and\nEUR 75,000,000 for the violation of Art. 14 GDPR.\n\n\nWith respect to Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR, the DPC found that WhatsApp had failed to provide information about the nature of the data collection 'in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.' This includes making the information easy for children to understand when it is addressed to them. For example, WhatsApp had distributed information about the relationship between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies and the sharing of data under that relationship through a variety of texts. Much of the information provided was of such general nature, moreover, that the DPC deemed it meaningless. Users often had to overcome multiple links to FAQs to get to the information they were looking for on WhatsApp's website. In this regard, the DPC stated that it would be unreasonable to expect users to search the WhatsApp website after failing to find sufficient information in the privacy statement itself.\n\nWith regard to Art. 14 GDPR, one of the issues was the impact of a user's consent allowing the messaging platform to have access to his or her contacts. As such, the company searched its users' contact information on their phones for phone numbers and other data, not only from other WhatsApp users, but also from contacts who do not even have a WhatsApp account. The DPC finds that this data had been processed unlawfully, as these contacts (especially those who do not have a WhatsApp account) had not received any information about this processing and therefore could not possibly have given their consent. \n\nGiven the seriousness and the far-reaching nature and impact of the breaches, the DPA concluded that there had also been a violation of the transparency principle from Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR.",

In addition, the purposes of the processing were not clearly stated. \nNo information was provided regarding the legal basis, the retention period of the personal data and the data subjects' right to object. Also, the privacy notice was confusing and the wording contained grammatical errors and used terms that are not part of common usage.\n\nIn addition, the privacy notice required a tax identification number in order to issue a simplified invoice, i.e., an invoice not exceeding the amount of EUR 3,000. The AEPD found this to be a violation of the principle of legality. \n\nThe fine is composed as follows:\n\nEUR 3,000 for a breach of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR;\nEUR 1,000 for a breach of Art. 21 (4) GDPR; and\nEUR 2,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 GDPR.",

The organization aims to support the safety and well-being of women and their children who have experienced violence in relationships. For this purpose, participants (men) come to weekly sessions in order to change their behavior. On February 3, 2021, the organization reported a data breach in accordance with Art. 33 GDPR.\nThe organization stated that eighteen SD cards had been lost, which may have contained recordings of group sessions of the MOVE program, in which participants discuss their behavior and attitudes regarding domestic violence with a group leader. Some of the participants could be seen and heard on the recordings.  In addition, the recordings included footage of participants discussing their behaviors and feelings regarding current or former partners, other family members, and friends who may have been named. Approximately 80-120 participants could have been affected by the data breach, as well as at least one group leader per recorded session. The DPC found that MOVE had breached its obligation under Art. 32 (1) GDPR by failing to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented by the processing of personal data through the recording of group sessions.",

At the same time, the CNIL received seven complaints from data subjects affected by this file.\n\nFor each of these individuals, the file contained information such as the organization they belonged to, the position they held, their business address, their business phone number, their cell phone number, their business email address, and in some cases their Twitter account. In addition, CNIL noted that each person was assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their influence, credibility, and support for Monsanto on various issues.\n\nThe DPA believes that the company violated the provisions of the GDPR by not informing the data subjects that their data was stored in this file. In addition, the CNIL complained that the company had not given the contractual guarantees that should normally regulate the relationship with a subcontractor. \n\nThe creation of contact files by stakeholders for lobbying purposes is not illegal in itself. However, CNIL stressed that data subjects nevertheless have the right to be informed of the existence of the file in order to exercise additional rights, in particular the right to object. \n\nIn addition, the CNIL found that the data collection was carried out by a provider contracted by Monsanto and that Monsanto violated Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation by not including in its contracts with the data processor the provisions foreseen in the GDPR, in particular regarding data security.",

In this context, the storage period of the various data had not been defined in a manner appropriate to the purpose. Instead, the controller had defined a flat storage period of six years. Furthermore, the Garante found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure adequate security of the processing. Deliveroo Italy had also not conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the risk posed to the drivers.",

        "summary": "The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 800,000 on Roma Capitale. The Garante had launched an investigation following a complaint from an individual who had complained about the new parking meters installed in the city in 2018. In fact, the company Atac s.p.a., which was also contracted by the city to manage the parking lots, had initiated a technical upgrade of the parking meters in order to offer new services (e.g., the payment of fines/fees or the purchase/renewal of public transport tickets) and introduce new payment methods that also take into account the vehicle's license plate number. Part of the equipment was supplied by another company, Flowbird Italia s.r.l. All parking information was then managed through a centralized system, which could also be accessed through an app by the employees responsible for controlling parking fees.\n\nIrregularities were then identified during the investigation. Namely, the city of Rome, as data controller, had not provided information on the processing of the drivers' data, had not designated the company Atac as data processor, and had not provided it with the necessary instructions to process the data collected. Also, the subcontractor was not formally instructed nor instructed on how to proceed with the data processing.\n\nIt was also found that the companies had not established a data processing register. Also, the retention periods for the collected data were not specified, and appropriate security measures were not taken. For example, it was found that at the time of the audit, some data flows to and from the system implemented by Atac were going through insecure channels. In addition, officials could have checked any license plate en masse and repeatedly over time, for example, to find out a person's habits and parking location. \n\n\nIn calculating the fine for the unlawful data processing, the DPA aggravatingly took into account the large amount of personal data processed (from June 2018 to November 2019, the system established by Atac had already collected the data of 8,600,000 stops and potentially affects all users of the paid parking service in the city area) and the sanctions already received for data protection violations, but also the positive cooperation offered by the city and the companies to remedy some violations detected during the inspection.",

By manipulating URLs, it was possible to gain access to PDF documents stored in the database.

        "summary": "The ICO has fined transgender charity Mermaids EUR 29,000 for failing to protect the personal data of its users, in breach of Art. 5 (1) f) UK GPDR and Art. 32 (1), (2) UK GDPR. \nThe ICO conducted an investigation after it received a report of a data breach relating to an internal email group.\nDuring the investigation, the ICO found that the group was created with insufficiently secure settings, resulting in approximately 780 pages of confidential emails being viewable online for nearly three years.  This resulted in personal information, such as names and email addresses, of 550 people being online. \nThe ICO concludes that Mermaids should have restricted access to its email group and could have considered pseudonymization or encryption to provide additional protection for the personal data. Organizations responsible for personal data must ensure that they take the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data.",

The use of the application on a mobile device also required authorization for location data collection. The collection of location data at the time of clocking in was a feature of the app, without which it was not possible to clock in working hours using the app.\n \nAccording to the information received from the controller, the controller did not actively use or exploit the location data in any situation, but only processed the location data at the time of clocking in for technical reasons. However, the mere fact that time clocking is not possible in the application without processing the location data does not make it necessary to process them.\nThe DPA therefore considered this to be a violation of the lawfulness of the data collection and of the principle of data minimization, since the processing of location data was not necessary for the purpose of the processing - i.e., the mere recording of working hours.",

The data controller, a telecommunications company using the services of the IT provider, informed the DPA as well its users of the potential breach of personal data by the IT provider. The incident consisted of a security breach which led to unauthorized access and processing of personal data by hackers and involved personal data of 28,085 respondents. The incident occurred because the IT provider had not taken the necessary measures to achieve an adequate level of security in accordance with existing and foreseeable risks. The IT provider, as a data processor, was obliged to take appropriate technical security measures in such a way as to ensure the permanent confidentiality of the system, including regular testing, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure security of processing. When assessing the appropriate level of security, the IT provider should have taken particular account of the risks of unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Due to failure to take appropriate technical measures for the security of personal data processing, the DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider. The amount of the fine is unknown at the moment. In its decision, the DPA took into account the nature of the IT provider’s business activity, whose role should be to support other entities through opinions and guidelines, proposing solutions for the implementation of web applications, and especially designing and implementing appropriate technical measures.",

The subscriber to the magazine was required to accept the terms of the subscription and contract, which included consent to direct marketing. If the consent to direct marketing was not given, the magazine could not be subscribed. The DPA states that the consent and the way it was obtained did not comply with the GDPR. Indeed, the consent was not specifically requested for direct marketing and the consent collected together with the subscription and contract terms did not constitute voluntary consent for the purpose of direct marketing. \n\nIn addition, it was not possible for data subjects to exercise their right to object due to the fact that the direct marketing calls were made using automated calling systems and the voice bots could not understand specific questions from data subjects about their data. \n\nFurthermore, the magazine publisher had commissioned a call center to carry out the advertising campaign and had not regulated its processing activities in a contract on commissioned processing.",

Since several hundred thousand people use public transportation in Stockholm every day, a large number of people were thus at risk of being monitored by video and audio recordings.\n\nThe DPA believes that body-worn camera technology could be used to prevent and document threatening situations, but that the pre-recording time should be reduced to a maximum of 15 seconds, as a longer pre-recording time is not necessary to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. Furthermore the DPA found that audio recordings did not contribute to the identification of persons without a valid ticket. The DPA therefore considered the audio recordings to be a violation of the principles of legality and transparency as well as data minimization.

        "summary": "The Icelandic DPA (Persónuvernd) has imposed a fine of EUR 34,000 on Huppuís ehf. A former employee filed a complaint against the controller with the DPA. The reason for this was the camera surveillance installed by the controller. During their shifts, the controller's employees wore clothing provided by the controller.However, the designated changing room of the store was a storage room in which large quantities of cleaning materials were stored.  Due to a lack of sufficient space in this room, the employees (mostly minors) had to change in the general employee area, which was covered by a video camera. The controller stated that they had installed the video camera for security purposes. The DPA concluded that the controller had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, but that the interests of the mostly underage employees must also be taken in account. The controller should have tried to implement less restrictive measures. In addition, the DPA underlined that the information on video surveillance was inadequate in both the employee and customer service areas. In determining the amount of the fine, the fact that a large number of the data subjects were minors was taken into account as an aggravating factor.",

Furthermore, the controller failed to fulfill its obligation to fully comply with the deletion requests received. \nThe CNIL also found that the controller did not implement sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure information security. Thus, for example, the controller did not require the use of a secure password during the process of opening an account the company´s website or when employees accessed the customer relationship management software.

The investigation against Foodinho mainly focused on the drivers of Foodinho. In the process, the DPA found some serious violations of applicable data protection regulations. Thus, the DPA identified some irregularities concerning the algorithms of the Foodinho system. In particular, the DPA found that the controller had not adequately informed employees about how the system worked and did not guarantee the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithms used to evaluate drivers. Furthermore, the DPA found violations of the principles of data minimization as well as memory limitation. For example, the systems processed drivers' data to an extent that exceeded the purpose of the processing and, in some cases, stored the data significantly longer than necessary. In addition, the controller had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure secure data processing. The controller had also not conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the considerable amount of data of different types relating to a significant number of data subjects.

The fine was based on the fact that the controller installed a video surveillance system totaling 14 video cameras and monitoring the business premises. The controller states that the cameras were installed for the purpose of security of the premises. However, the cameras captured the employees' offices in a way that was not necessary for this purpose. For example, one camera also captured a considerable part of the employees' recreation room. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principle of data minimization. In addition, the controller had not properly informed the data subjects about the processing of the data by the video surveillance and thus violated its duty to inform.

About 2000 people were potentially affected by the breach. Due to the data breach, errors had occurred in vaccine registration. As a result, the data subjects were at risk of receiving the wrong vaccines. There was also a potential for their immunization data to be misfiled in the national immunization registry.\nFurthermore, errors occurred in follow-ups for pregnant women, including information on the week of pregnancy or the mother's drug use. \nAlso, patient information was provided to health workers in a health service ward without being required and without access being documented.",

In its investigation against the cotroller, the DPA found that the cotroller had in fact processed personal data for telemarketing activities that it had not collected directly but had acquired from other sources. It had not checked whether valid consents had been obtained from the advertising addressees for all transfers of the data. The controller had received lists of personal data from one company, which in turn had acquired them from two other companies. The latter companies had obtained the consent of potential customers for the telemarketing carried out by them and by third parties, but this consent did not include the transfer of customer data to the controller.

The DPA's investigation revealed that the municipality had been using a system to control and filter employees' internet browsing for about a decade, with monthly retention of data and creation of special reports for network security purposes. The system also collected information that had nothing to do with professional activities and, in any case, concerned the private life of the person in question.\nThe DPA finds that the controller thus violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The controller should rather have taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of the Internet. The DPA pointed out that the need to reduce the risk of misuse of Internet navigation cannot lead to the complete elimination of any privacy of the data subject at the workplace, even in cases where the employee uses network services provided by the employer. In addition, the controller had not adequately informed employees about the collection of Internet history, in violation of its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR. \nFurthermore, the investigation identified other violations in the processing of data related to employees' requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which were made using a special form. The form provided by the controller had to be checked by the head of the organizational unit, a circumstance that led to the unlawful processing of health data.",

A number of people had been issued parking tickets by the controller and had thereupon requested information about which personal data was being processed and, in some cases, requested the deletion of their data.\nHowever, in order to process the requests, the controller stated that it needed the ID card number and address of the data subjects for identification purposes, as their name with the parking ticket number was not sufficient to verify their identity. According to the DPA, the controller has not only violated its duty to inform the data subjects and the right to delete their data, but has also violated the principle of data minimization. The DPA stressed that it is permitted to request further proof of identification if there are reasonable doubts about the identity of the data subject. However, in the cases in question, no such doubts had existed. Furthermore, the DPA found a violation of the principle of storage limitation. The controller had stored photos of incorrectly parked cars and copies of parking tickets for possible future disputes in court without having defined a deadline for the deletion of the data.",

Following a complaint from a former customer, claiming that the bank did not comply with his request to erasure of his data, the DPA started an investigation against the controller. The data subject had already been a customer of the bank in the past. At that time, he had exercised his right to erasure of his data. When he tried to open a new account with the controller, he was informed that this was not possible as his data was still blocked (due to his previous erasure request). The controller further informed the data subject that he would have to unblock the data if he wanted to open an account. For this purpose, a form was attached to the letter. The form stated that by signing it, the data subject was revoking his right to erasure and allowing his data to be used (again) by the controller. The DPA found that temporarily blocking the data, does not correspond to the right to erasure. The DPA also emphasized that deleted or blocked data may not be processed again when a new contractual relationship is entered into with the controller, even if the new processing purpose is the same as the previous one. The original fine of EUR 100,000 was reduced to EUR 60,000 euros due to the immediate payment and acknowledgement of guilt.",

In the letter, the controller informed the data subject that her driver's license would soon expire. In response to a inquiry from the data subject as to where her new contact information came from, the controller informed her that its database was regularly updated using data obtained from the Spanish transport authority DGT (Dirección General de Tráfico). As the data subject had not given consent for such processing of her data, she filed a complaint against the controller with the Spanish DPA. An investigation by the DPA revealed that the company had indeed entered into a contract with DGT. However, DGT had clarified that the purpose of the processing of contact data under the contract was to ensure the accuracy of the address when renewing a driver's license or when issuing medical reports so that it could be sent to the correct address. Nevertheless, the data subjects must request and consequently consent to such a change of address. Since these criteria were not met in the specific case, the DPA found a violation of the purpose limitation principle.",

In 2017, the municipality decided to install special measurement boxes to measure crowds in the city center of Enschede. Sensors in the measurement boxes detected the wifi signals from the cell phones of passers-by and registered them with a code. Based on the registered codes, it was possible to calculate how busy the city center was. However, this also made it possible to track which measurement box a particular cell phone passed by, making it possible to track the movement of passers-by. The municipality states that it was never its intention to track passers-by. However, the DPA finds that the wifi tracking (even if it was unintentional) constitutes a serious breach of the GDPR. The DPA concludes that the municipality tracked its passers-by without an effective legal basis and thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR.",

From the records, the names, floors and apartment numbers of the meeting participants could be obtained, as well as the floors and apartment numbers of neighbors about whom the participants had complained during the meeting. The controller had justified the public notice with the fact that the results of this meeting concerned planned legal actions against some of the residential parties. They were to be informed about this so that they would not be able to claim later that they had not received the relevant notifications. The DPA considers this to be a violation of Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR, which refers to the principles of integrity and confidentiality of personal data.",

        "summary": "The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) imposed a fine of EUR 14,900 on the energy company Dragefossen AS. The latter had installed a webcam on the roof of its office building in the center of Rognan which was in operation 24/7 and recorded the city center. These recordings could be viewed via a live video stream on Youtube and on the controller's homepage. In addition, the recordings could be rewound for up to twelve hours. \n\nThe area covered by the camera surveillance included a public street, the parking lot and entrance of two grocery stores, a pharmacy, a liquor store, the local bank, city hall, and a number of other buildings.\n\nIt was not possible to make out facial details or read license plates on cars due to the image quality and distance from the camera. Nevertheless, the image quality was good enough to be able to identify what type of car the data subjects were driving, what type of clothing they were wearing, what hair color they had, and other personal characteristics. This was sufficient for those watching the live broadcast to identify and track co-workers, colleagues, friends, family, or other acquaintances.\n\nThe Norwegian DPA concluded that the live broadcast constitutes a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) a) GPDR.\n\nThe decision highlights that the illegal camera surveillance involved a significant number of employees and that many were monitored repeatedly, some on a daily basis. Those who were monitored were on their way to and from work, who needed to buy groceries, medications, or alcohol, or who were in the public area for other reasons. These are activities where the data subjects do not expect to be monitored, and even less they expect the monitoring to be broadcast live on the Internet.",

After press reports raised problems with the institute's data processing practices around the application review of politicians, the Italian DPA opened an investigation against INPS in August 2020. During that investigation, the DPA identified several violations. \n\nThe controller had collected data on tens of thousands of politicians from public sources and cross-checked it with data from applicants. In doing so, however, the controller had failed to ensure that data was collected only from those politicians who were eligible to receive the assistance funds. In doing so, the controller violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency as set out in the GDPR.\n\nFurthermore, the controller had violated the principle of data minimization by initiating checks on reimbursements even for individuals whose applications had been rejected and who had therefore never received payments.\n\nFurthermore, the controller had not adequately assessed the risks associated with a data processing operation as sensitive as that on applications for social benefits, since it had not carried out an impact assessment on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Update: Following an appeal presented by INPS the judge of the XVIII civil section of the Court of Rome annulled the fine of EUR 300,000.",

        "summary": "Originally, a fine in the amount of EUR 14.500.000 was issued against Deutsche Wohnen SE for using an archiving system for the storage of personal data of tenants that, according to the data protection authority, did not provide for the possibility of removing data that was no longer required. According to the data protection authority, personal data of tenants were stored without checking whether storage was permissible or even necessary and it was therefore possible to access personal data of affected tenants which had been stored for years without this data still serving the purpose of its original collection. This involved data on the personal and financial circumstances of tenants, such as salary statements, self-disclosure forms, extracts from employment and training contracts, tax, social security and health insurance data as well as bank statements. In addition to sanctioning this structural violation, the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases. See the separate entry. *** UPDATE *** On 24 February 2021 the Berlin Regional Court has dismissed the fine against Deutsche Wohnen SE due to procedural errors, see link and link. This was based on the fact that, according to German law, a fine can only be issued to a company if the offence is attributable to a natural person, such as a managing director or employee. The case was then appealed to the Appellate Court of Berlin, which on 16 December 2022 in turn referred it to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary decision on whether the Regional Court's decision aligned with European law. On 5 December 2023 the European Court of Justice ruled that while culpability is indeed required for a fine to be issued, it is not always necessary to attribute the offence to a natural person. If the controller is a company instead of a natural person, it shall suffice if the offence is attributable to the company itself. In light of this decision the Appellate Court of Berlin overturned the initial decision of the Regional Court of Berlin and referred the case back to the Regional Court of Berlin for a new decision which, at the time of the editorial deadline of this update, is still pending, see link",

The DPA found that the security company as a data processor enabled the breach by not maintaining adequate and sufficient technical and organizational measures for personal data security for more than two and a half years. Moreover, the processor has not foreseen or implemented adequate technical security measures following the incident to prevent or minimize the risks. One data subject was consequently exposed to insults and ridicule in the public and the security company has not taken any action to remove the recording from social networks and media. The amount of the fine is unknown at the moment, but the DPA clarified which aggravating circumstances it has taken into consideration when determining the fine – (i) the fact that the processor did not fulfil its obligation to inform the controller of the incident as required by the Art 33 (2) GDPR and (ii) the fact that the basic activity of the company is the provision of physical and technical protection, which includes the use of video surveillance. The DPA also noted that the fined security company is one of the leading companies in Croatia in that activity and as such should be the relevant entity in providing opinions, guidelines, advice and propose solutions to controllers on the use of the video surveillance system and give an example to its work and pay greater attention to it than others.",

Additionally, the company had not established and documented deadlines for deletion of personal data in their new CRM system. The deadlines set for the old system were not deleted after the deadline for the information had been reached. Also, the controller had not adequately documented its personal data deletion procedures. \n\nPlease note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. \n\nUpdate: On February 12, 2021 the Aarhus District Court decided to impose a fine against IDdesign in the amount of EUR 13,450. With regard to the calculation of the fine, the court disagreed with the proposed amount of the fine. It concluded that the amount should be calculated on the basis of the company's own turnover and not that of the entire group. In addition, the court considered that the mitigating circumstances under Art. 83 (2) GDPR should be taken into account when calculating the fine. Such as that the company had not previously breached the GDPR, as well as that the breach concerned only general personal data. In addition, no data subject suffered damages as a result of the breach. Finally, the court considers that the negligent nature of the breach should be taken into account.",

Also, the information on the rights of the data subjects as well as the contact information of the controller were not provided in a consistent manner. \n\nFurthermore, the DPA notes that the controller had processed its customers' data beyond its legitimate interests, partly without a legal basis, and that the consent it obtained from customers did not meet the requirements of an effective consent. In addition, deficiencies in the company's procedures allowed it to obtain the consent of customers to process their personal data.

The company stated that the purpose of the installed video cameras was to prevent and investigate criminal acts and to track the movement of goods in the warehouses. However, to prevent theft, a company must first consider milder methods. Moreover, video surveillance to detect criminal acts is only permitted if there is a reasonable suspicion against specific persons. If this is the case, it may be permissible to monitor them with cameras for a limited period of time. At notebooksbilliger.de, however, the video surveillance was neither limited to a specific period nor to specific employees. In addition, the recordings were stored for 60 days in many cases, which was significantly longer than required. Customers of notebooksbilliger.de were also affected by the unlawful video surveillance, as some cameras were pointed at seating areas in the sales area.

This made it possible to monitor employees and patients around the clock. The clinic relied on consent given by employees and information signs as the legal basis for the video surveillance. However, the DPA concluded that the clinic could not base the video surveillance on consent, as voluntary consent in the employee-employer relationship is questionable. Also, clearly visible notices of the video surveillance do not allow the conclusion that the patients, by entering the monitored premises, legally express their consent to the observation. The DPA could not find any other evidence that would justify such extensive video surveillance of the clinic.",

One employee photographed the declaration with his cell phone and spread it via WhatsApp. Subsequently, the document was posted on the social network Facebook and on a website.\nThis situation led to the disclosure and unauthorized access of certain personal data concerning four data subjects, despite the Bank's commitment to respect the principle of integrity and confidentiality of personal data as required by Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR.\nThe DPA notes that the occurred disclosure of the data also proves the ineffectiveness of the internal training of the Bank's employees regarding compliance with the standards for data protection.

In one of the subsystems, a lack of ability to restrict user access to the data has allowed a significant number of staff to access information about students using a protected identity. In another sub-system, parents could access information about other students, such as grades relatively easily. Via Google's search engine, it was possible to find links to enter an administrative interface where information about teachers with a protected identity was accessible.",

A caller could obtain extensive information on personal customer data from the company's customer service department simply by entering a customer's name and date of birth. In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low. Furthermore, according to the court, the violation was also rather minor, as it could not lead to a massive data leakage.",

A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.\n\nIt is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.\n\n--> Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of £ 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.",

The proposed fine relates to a cyber incident notified to the ICO by British Airways in September 2018. This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.\n\nIn the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at £20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000). The ICO emphasized that when setting the amount of the fine, it also took into account the economic impact of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic on the airline industry.",

Here, according to the findings of the Hamburg data protection officer, since at least 2014 private life circumstances of some of the employees have been comprehensively recorded and this information stored on a network drive. For example, the company conducted a 'Welcome Back Talk' after employees returned to work after vacation or illness. The information that became known in this context - including information on the symptoms of illness and diagnoses of the employees - was recorded and stored. In addition, according to the Hamburg data protection authority, some supervisors also used the 'Flurfunk' [meaning to hear something through the grapevine] to acquire a broad knowledge of individual employees, for example about family problems and religious beliefs. The information stored on the network drive was accessible to up to 50 managers of the company and was used, among other things, to evaluate the work performance of the employees and to make employment decisions.The data collection became known due to a technical configuration error in October 2019, according to which the data stored on the network drive was accessible company-wide for several hours. After the violation became known, the management apologized to the employees and offered monetary compensation. In addition, also further protective measures were introduced together with the data protection authority. [Note: Concrete legal basis of the fine not yet published - we assume this will mainly be Art. 5 and 6 GDPR]",

There, users have the option to set the visibility of their posts to private or public. Private posts can only be seen by subscribers of the respective user profile, while public posts are visible to the public. A programming bug in Twitter's Android app resulted in some private posts being visible to the public. The DPA found that Twitter had not properly fulfilled its reporting and documentation obligations. Twitter's legal team became aware of the error on January 2nd, 2019, and it was not until January 8th that the company informed the DPC. Consequently, the company failed to inform the DPC within the 72-hour period required by Art. 33 (1) GDPR. Furthermore, it had failed to adequately document the incident in accordance with Art. 33 (5) GDPR.",

That included their names, addresses and phone numbers, as well as details about their booking. The criminals also accessed the credit card data of 283 people and managed to access the credit card's security code in 97 cases. Furthermore, they tried to get other victims' credit card details by pretending to be Booking.com employees via email or phone. Booking.com was notified of the data breach on January 13, 2019, but did not report it to the DPA until February 7, 2019.

One of the main criticisms made by the Data Protection Agency was the use of fake numbers to make promotional calls by the contracted call centers (i.e. phone numbers not registered with the National Consolidated Registry of Communication Operators). Furthermore, further violations could be found in the handling of contact lists purchased from external providers. Finally, security measures for the management of customer data were also considered inadequate.",

In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low. Furthermore, according to the court, the violation was also rather minor, as it could not lead to a massive data leakage.",

A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.\n\nIt is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.\n\n--> Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of £ 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.",

This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.\n\nIn the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at £20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000). The ICO emphasized that when setting the amount of the fine, it also took into account the economic impact of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic on the airline industry.",

Here, according to the findings of the Hamburg data protection officer, since at least 2014 private life circumstances of some of the employees have been comprehensively recorded and this information stored on a network drive. For example, the company conducted a 'Welcome Back Talk' after employees returned to work after vacation or illness. The information that became known in this context - including information on the symptoms of illness and diagnoses of the employees - was recorded and stored. In addition, according to the Hamburg data protection authority, some supervisors also used the 'Flurfunk' [meaning to hear something through the grapevine] to acquire a broad knowledge of individual employees, for example about family problems and religious beliefs. The information stored on the network drive was accessible to up to 50 managers of the company and was used, among other things, to evaluate the work performance of the employees and to make employment decisions.The data collection became known due to a technical configuration error in October 2019, according to which the data stored on the network drive was accessible company-wide for several hours. After the violation became known, the management apologized to the employees and offered monetary compensation. In addition, also further protective measures were introduced together with the data protection authority. [Note: Concrete legal basis of the fine not yet published - we assume this will mainly be Art. 5 and 6 GDPR]",

        "summary": "The Belgian data protection authority has fined Google Belgium SA, a subsidiary of Google, 600,000 euros. The reasons for the fine were the rejection of an application by a data subject for dereferencing outdated articles that the data subject had considered to be damaging to its reputation, and lack of transparency in Google's form for dereferencing applications. The Belgian data protection authority found that articles relating to unfounded harassment complaints could have serious consequences for the data subjects, and natural persons were therefore entitled to have articles deleted/dereferenced. This also applies to persons who hold political office, even though these offices are generally less worthy of protection due to their public status and articles relating to political persons may therefore be stored for a longer period of time. Google's rejection of the application was therefore in breach of Article 17 of the GDPR (fine for this breach: €500,000). In addition, a further €100,000 was imposed for breach of the principle of transparency, as Google's rejection of the request for deletion was not sufficiently justified",

During the procedure initiated based on data subject’s complaints, the DPA ordered the bank to enable the right of access and provide copies of the requested loan documentation.

Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten had already completed a review in 2017 of the way in which Google deals with the right of individuals to have search results removed from Google's search engine and that Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten had instructed Google to remove a number of search results. In addition, data inspections stated that it had initiated a further review of Google's practices in 2018 after it received indications that several of the results that should have been removed still appeared in search results. Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten also objected to Google's current practice of informing web site owners about which results Google is removing from search results, specifically which link has been removed and who is behind the request for removal from the list, as this is without legal basis.\n\nUpdate: On November 23th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the The Administrative Court of Stockholm announced that it had rejected Google LLC´s appeal.\nHowever the court reduced the fine from a total of SEK 75 million (approx. EUR  7 million) to SEK 52 million (approx. EUR 5 million).",

In addition, incorrect and non-transparent information on data processing was provided in Apps provided by the Company and invalid methods of consent were used. In some cases, paper forms requesting one single consent were used for various purposes, including marketing. Furthermore, data was kept longer than necessary and thus violated deletion periods. \n\nFor these violations, the telecommunications company received a fine of EUR 27.8 million. Among other things, the fine was imposed for: lack of consent for marketing activities (telemarketing and cold calling), addressing of data subjects who asked not to be contacted with marketing offers, invalid consents collected in TIM apps, lack of appropriate security measures to protect personal data (including incorrect exchange of blacklists with call centres), lack of clear data retention periods. The supervisory authority also imposed 20 corrective measures on TIM, prohibiting the use of personal data for marketing purposes from those who had refused to receive promotional calls from the call centres.",

In the process, the DPA discovered that an outdated web store application was used on the site, which was no longer provided with security updates. The developer had explicitly warned against further use of this version, as it contained significant security vulnerabilities. The investigations of the DPA further revealed that the passwords stored in the database were not sufficiently secured. The DPA concluded that the technical measures taken by the responsible party were not adequate for the protection requirements of the GDPR, resulting in a violation of Art. 32 GDPR.",

Some time later, he registered for a course at another company of the same parent company and was rejected there. As a reason, he was told that he still had arrears with the company whose courses he had already attended. Following a complaint filed by the individual against the company, the DPA launched an investigation. It found that those companies shared a common database. It pointed out that the maintenance of a common customer database by several, legally independent companies, leads to joint responsibility according to Art. 26 GDPR. According to Art. 26 (2) GDPR, this requires an agreement that reflects the respective actual functions and relationships of the jointly responsible parties towards data subjects. However, such an agreement did not exist.",

The company advertises that it guarantees one hundred percent anonymity. On the platform, users can upload photos of underwear. In most cases, smartphones or other mobile devices were used to take the photos. The camera apps of the smartphones or GPS modules of the cameras often store additional information in the image file alongside the actual image as a standard setting. Based on this data, a fairly precise localization is possible. A review by the DPA revealed that the company had not cleaned up the residual information or metadata in the uploaded photos. Consequently, the data could be entered into any map service and the exact location where the photo was taken could be determined. The number of data subjects involved was approximately around 760 women between the ages of 18 and 50. For this reason, the DPA found that the company had failed to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the data subjects. In addition, the DPA concluded that the company had unlawfully processed the associated data by uploading the photos without cleaning them.",

The supervisory authority is of the opinion that biometric data of students was processed which is why Art. 9 GDPR is applicable. Additionally, the authority argued that consent can not be applied since students and their guardians cannot freely decide if they/their children want to be monitored for attendance purposes. When examining if the school board can rely on any of the exemptions listed in Art. 9 (2), the supervisory authority found that this was not the case. The supervisory authority also found that there was a case of a processing activity with high risks since new technology was used to process sensitive personal data concerning children who are in a dependency position to the high school board and due to camera surveillance being used in the students everyday environment. In the view of the authority, the school board was not able to demonstrate compliance with Art. 35 GDPR and that the school board was required to consult the authority in accordance with Art. 36 (1) GDPR.",

In addition, the company gave employees the false impression that it was processing their personal data under the legal basis of consent, while in reality it was processing their data under a different legal basis.  This was in violation of the principle of transparency and thus in breach of the obligation to provide information under Articles 13(1)(c) and 14(1)(c) of the GDPR. Lastly, in violation of the accountability principle, the company failed to provide the HDPA with evidence that it had carried out a prior assessment of the appropriate legal bases for processing employee personal data",

To force the hospital to improve the security of patient records, the AP simultaneously imposes an order subject to a penalty.

This infringement is not attributable to the police officer's department, since he did not commit the act in the exercise of his official duties, but exclusively for private purposes.

It is worth it to mention that the proceeding initiated before May 2018, but the Italian data protection authority issued a fine under the GDPR since the Rousseau platform had not adopted security measures required by means of an order issued after the 25th of May 2018.

As mandated by law, the fine was based on 4% of the party's annual turnover and 2.65 % of its anticipated turnover for the coming year.\n\nThe breach was the result of a cyber attack by an anonymous hacker who accessed and disclosed information on the vulnerability of the organisation’s system – a database of more than 6,000 individuals – and the command used for the attack.

The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity – entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) – (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation – as it explained in the course of the proceedings – due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. According to the UODO this is not sufficient.\n\nAddendum: In the meantime, the court has cancelled the fine due to procedural errors. The amount of the fine has to be determined by the concrete number of data records concerned. However, the Office had not submitted any verifiable evidence in this regard, but had simply assumed that 6 million data sets were involved, which the data controller had denied. Therefore, important statements were missing. In particular, it was incorrect to justify the amount of the fine on the basis of general preventive considerations. Art. 58 GDPR expressly states that a fine imposed must be related to the specific facts of the case. The Polish data protection authority has already announced that the fine will be revised in a new administrative procedure.",
