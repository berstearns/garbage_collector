Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
What is the purpose of knowledge? Living in the end of the twentieth century is both difficult and easy to answer a question like that. But it is important to do so at least for ourselves .
The Earth with all its secrets, existing long before man had a chance to appear on it, has always been challenging mystery for people. Humans are created tireless investigators, eager discoverers, active thinkers. Knowledge for them is a goal, a condition, pleasure and a leader to improvement of they lives .
It seems logical enough for everybody to see the importance of the discoveries in science - they practically lead to welfare in the material sphere of life, or help to preserve life in the form considered normal. With science fields like Geography, Sociology, History, Law, Political Studies, Language Studies it is a little more difficult to define in what way they are useful in the real world .
Some of them serve society. Some of them just serve people's passion for theorizing, statistics - making, categorizing, going into the abstract. I do not know whether most university degrees are theoretical, but I can well tell about mine, which I am studying at present. It is called "English and American Studies" and it is maybe the ideal example of a degree which does not prepare students for the ' real world'. One side of this real world is the opportunities for a professional realization after graduation. Everyone who has heard about this educational programme has asked the question, "So what would you do after you graduate? Become a teacher?"
Well a difficult question indeed. Having studied all British and American history, literature and culture and having received profound knowledge in the field of linguistics (including Historical Linguistics) the poor graduate finds himself at a loss in a society which either needs him for a teacher, a translator, a tourist guide, or merely as someone who knows English and could sit all day at a secretary's desk, or else for nothing at all. It somehow does not seem "fair". Five years' striving in the labyrinth of science and then all knowledge has to be stored in one's consciousness of a learned man .
Of course, in any country different societies exist and the opportunities vary, as well as the values. In my opinion, young people should be well aware of their aims before they apply for a certain degree. If they cannot estimate by themselves, they should be able to receive advise. On the other hand, this means that young people at the age of eighteen have to be able to think as people at the age of twenty-three, which is an awful prospect. The dilemma is clear - either grow old before their time has come or prepare themselves to be disappointed and helpless when it would be late to think with their mature minds .
What I can conclude about this problem is that what we have is not a case so much of inadequate education but rather of inadequate society, because in a modern society there has to be place for all those who deal with impractical science; for knowledge is not a means for making material progress only. If it was, what would man be like?
