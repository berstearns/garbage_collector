Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
Nowadays education is indispensable for people in order to find their place in the real world. But is university education, in particular, of great help to one in doing this ? To my mind, most people would answer negatively to this question. Very often one feels dejected on finding out that after they have studied hard for 5 years in a university, most of the extensive knowledge that they accumulated there will hardly ever be useful to them in the real world. The reason for this is the fact that university education is much more theoretical than practical which turns out to be a decided disadvantage. One must always bear in mind that what matters more is not how much one knows but how well they can use what they know. Thus, it is pointless just to sit down and acquire knowledge solely in order to pass one's exams when one may probably never use it afterwards .
However, most universities maintain the tradition and continue teaching theory as before .
Last year, for example, we had a course in computing which was, on the whole, completely useless. Instead of being taught how to use a computer and different kinds of software, most of our time was taken up by theoretical explanations of the way in which computers work. I do not mean that this information is absolutely unnecessary but my point is that it is good for nothing when you do not know how to use a computer in order to write and print out our essay, for instance .
On the other hand, it would not be really true to say that university degrees are wholly unrewarding. Theoretical education may be less valuable than practical for one's life in the real world but, nevertheless it is very important. The reason for this is that no matter how irrelevant or impracticable it may be, it still provides one with some general idea about things in life and thus may serve as a standard for comparison. Then, as one has already formed some model to refer to, it would be easier for them to decide what to do in a certain situation. Despite the difficulty of putting theory in practice, it is far easier to do than to start directly with the latter. So, after all, it is much better to have theoretical knowledge than not to have any at all .
Both teachers and students have been aware of this particular deficiency of university education and its respective influence in one's life, so attempts have been made to correct it. One possible way of doing this has been through introduction and development of various applied sciences in recent years, like applied mathematics, applied linguistic and others. These, however, are not very wide-spread and only a small number of universities have them as separate courses .
Another way of making university degrees more useful to students is to achieve a certain balance between the two sides of education. Moreover, one should be free to choose whether to concentrate on theory or practice with respect to their future plans and personal preferences. This is very important because different jobs require different types of knowledge and what would be valuable for one student, would be of no use to another .
To sum it up, I would say that one cannot so quickly write university degrees and education off. There are still valid although they do not give one full knowledge of the real world. If they are not as good as they could be, it is up to us to change them and to make them better .
Then one will feel more confident on leaving university that they are ready to cope with problems and difficulties in life .
