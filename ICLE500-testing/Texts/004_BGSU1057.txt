Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The world we are living in is without any doubt a modern and civilized one. It is not like the world five hundred years ago, it is not even like the one fifty years ago. Perhaps we - the people who live nowadays, are happier than our ancestors, but perhaps we are not .
The strange thing is that we judge and analyse their world without knowing it and maybe without trying to know it. The only thing that is certain is that the world is changing and it is changing so fast that even we cannot notice it. Sciece has developed to such an extent that it is difficult to believe this can be true. A simple but quite impressive example of this development is the genetic engineering. Scientists have achieved something which was considered impossible and even monstrous before. Probably just in a few years they will be able to create a rational human being. Technology and industrialisation have also developed and in the present moment they do not stop developing. The consumers are overwhelmed by all kinds of products and goods. Technology is everywhere - in the houses, in the streets, in the shopping centers. We cannot run away from it even if we want to .
On the other hand we do need all these new technical products. We can no longer imagine our lives without a TV set or without a telephone. Computer systems like Internet enable us to communicate easy and fast. We are modern people and as modern people we are surrounded by all these things, by all these products of science technology and industry. This is our world. Whether we like it or not we must live in it. But all these inventions and innovations cannot change us - we remain human beings. With or without a washing machine we do not turn into animals. People are capable of adjusting to their environment and to remain humans .
In my opinion, technology cannot change us so much and to make us forget what is to dream and imagine. There is always place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world. If there was not imagination our lives would have been so dull and colourless and everybody would have gone crazy. I do not think that we can live without dreaming. Because if we do not dream we would not have any aims to achieve, we would not see a light in the end of the tunnel of life. It is our imagination that helps us go through the difficult moments in life. For example when your boyfriend leaves you it is such a relief to imagine that you will smash his face the next time you see him .
This is just a small relief but sometimes it helps you to feel better. But imagination helps not only in such cases it helps us to create our own world in our minds. A world where we could go whenever we feel the need to escape from the real one. A world where everything is the way we want it to be, where people are good and love is real. It is a fairy tale where we can go and relax, it is the improved mirror image of reality .
Imagination and dreaming will always have place in our modern or not so modern world .
Without them neither art nor literature will exist. And the fact that they still exist is a proof of the existence of imagination. If it was not for it I would not be able to write this essay, would I?
