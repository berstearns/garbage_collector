Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
It is a truth universally acknowledged that our age is the age of machines. Technology, industrialization and communications have developed and are still developing at a very fast rate. It is actually so fast that you find it difficult to keep pace with it. Thus if you buy a computer, for instance, that you are assured is the newest product of the industry at the present moment, you will certainly be surprised to find out in a year's time that what you paid dearly for a year ago constitutes nothing more than a useless heap of junk. In this way the new technologies and innovations which are meant to help man and make things more comfortable, actually reach the point of being rather an unpleasant nuisance. Thus, at a certain point of time you will probably find it much more easy to steer a spaceship than to operate a TV set. It may sound absurd today but in my view could well be the case in near future .
There are things in life, though , that don't change as quickly as that and that even are considered by some ever lasating. Such are the works of art that people have been producing eversince the dawn of human civilization. These works are products of people's imagination and dreaming rather than of rational thinking .
Basically imagination and dreaming are associated with concepts like creativity, freedom of mind and soul whereas practical thinking stands for reason. In my view imagination and dreaming require a simplicity of heart and soul that is to say, mind released from the burden of the artificial, mechanical thinking, which is inevitably imposed by the rich in technologies and computers everyday life. To my mind it's the children that enjoy this freedom of mind and soul today. They are the ones who feel at ease in the world of dreams. Children can see and observe what grown-ups are unable to because only they possess the purity and sharpness of the senses that vanishes once you grow up. How can a mind burdened with reason, scientific explanations and mathematical logic allow itself to dream or imagine. This is in my view impossible because these concepts are too opposite to co-exist .
The computers and technologies that keep on pervading our lives, providing us with ready products, which being useful on the one hand devoid people of the opportunity to think and develop their inventiveness. People become rather one-sided, develop pragmatic thinking and are easily involved in what some call "The rat race" . It is, however dangerous to go on trying to keep pace with the constantly developing science and technology because it might turn out at a certain point of time that man has fallen prey to his own creations .
