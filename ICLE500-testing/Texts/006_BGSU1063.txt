Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
There are quite a few people who think that higher education is unnecessary and that there is no point in studying at university. With the technical schools and the gymnasiums being rather popular nowadays most students would consider it enough to complete high school and don't take the trouble to continue studying at a higher level. This phenomenon alone is quite eloquent and understandable too. And one doesn't have to search very hard to reach the conclusion that there are plenty of factors contributing to that unfavorable attitude that people in Bulgaria have towards university education .
Just take a stroll downtown to the marketplace and you'll find why so many people consider university studying useless. There is hardly any person in the world who can convince me that one needs to graduate Nuclear Physics to sell cucumbers or to have a PHD in literature to deliver newspapers. However, if one goes to an average Bulgarian marketplace one is most likely to encounter qualified people doing low-paid unqualified work. I haven't seen any recent statistics but I'm sure that the number of people who work in the field they have specialized in is very low. What is the point then to study when you know you'll end up cleaning lavatories or washing dishes? Naturally these are jobs like any other but you don't normally study all that much to be able to perform them. And knowing that once you graduate you join the long gray queue of young unemployed people is hardly any stimulus for a young person to apply for university .
Unfortunately unemployment is a major threat not only to those who study theoretical matters but to graduates of the technical institutes too. People studying practical things such as engineering unable to find decent jobs is, I'm sure most people would agree, not the rightest of prospects. And thus most of these graduates become frustrated due to the lack of proper occupation and consequently much energy, talent and knowledge is wasted. Then one starts to wonder whether there's any point in studying at all. In the last few years, though, things have changed a bit. As the country shows some signs of improvement in terms of economics and political stability people start to see a light at the end of the tunnel .
