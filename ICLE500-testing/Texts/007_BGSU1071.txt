Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
What is the purpose of education? To provide us with knowledge that, together with our tastes, will help us take the profession that best sorts our abilities. A good university degree should serve as a ' passport ' to decent jobs within the range of one's qualification. All this means that university and real life should be in constant feed back. What we have, though, today is education that often loses track of reality, and degrees that indicate how does one manage on one's exams and with one's papers and thesis. Degrees have nothing to do with our capability for a certain job .
Take, first, the present situation in Bulgaria as a whole. In the period of what we think, and hope, to be a transition to a free-market economy, education gradually lost its position of a primal value in people's lives. In its place came ' free initiative', and a lot of people (including the young) gave themselves to amassing money through trade which often turned out to be nothing mote than a swindle . Aversion from study can be rooted in the fact that while you study, you do not earn money, but only accumulate knowledge and prepare for a future job. The deeper reason, though, must lie in the nature of education itself. The reason, it seems to me, is namely its irrelevance to life. You have to know what you study for, in the first place. In Bulgaria, we know that the moment we graduate we will be confronted by the risk of entering the army of unemployed. Our good diplomas will remain but a record on paper. And even if that does not happen, we are still very likely to take jobs that have nothing to do with what we had studied for. With all that in mind you soon end up asking yourself, ' Why study?'.
If, on the other hand, we take an inside look at the way study is being organised, we will soon notice a certain formula shared between students and lecturers. The time spent at university should prepare students for making well at their exams and, possibly, for writing good papers. Not a thought for students' future appliance. In such situation everyone has to take care of themselves, which not always gives the best of results .
To make the picture more complicated still, universities do not keep record of the demands of society. On many subjects the curricula still need updating, with others the problem is the vast number of students on admission. Very few of them will find job relevant to their study because all the vacancies have already been filled in by students who have graduated a couple of years ago .
The most natural thing for the universities to do would be to keep in touch with all the big and minor companies, all the national institutions, plus various foundations and committees and make a running record of their demands and offers on the one hand, and of students' capacities on the other. Another useful thing to do would be to arrange a system of training courses for students while still in their university. A simile of such system exists today, but it neither provides us with helpful skills nor enables us to make contacts in the sphere we are put in for a while, so that in the future we could be appointed for a certain position should we be approved. In the sphere of languages, for example, these courses offer you only the option of ' training ' yourself for a teacher (as if a specialist in English or German or any other language and literature can do nothing else!).
I do not know how things are in the sphere of law (one of the trendiest subjects nowadays, together with economics and a few more), but I cannot believe that students there have much wider range of opportunities to choose from .
Universities are not the only to blame. The whole arrangement (or rather disarrangement of our society is such that some very important links are missing - either cut or not yet woven into the new network. Thus, what we need is a through and complete reform both inside the educational system and outside, in the society. It involves a hard work to do, but the result may prove worth the efforts so that one day we could claim to have put into practice the Latin proverb ' We study for life ' not for study itself"!
