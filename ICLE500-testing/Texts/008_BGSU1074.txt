Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
It is a fact that even well-educated people find themselves in a state of bewilderment at the mere thought of the speed in which technologies are revolutionizing the world. and no wonder, for I doubt it that there is anyone who hasn't been plagued with this feeling of uncertainty. It is, therefore, only natural that the effect of the so-called technological threat be exaggerated .
Obviously, if we are to avoid the hazard of falling into much extremes we need to find reasonable answers to the following questions: why is this negativistic attitude against technologies taking place ' how can analogical events in the past help us evaluate the present situation; why are not technologies overpowering the human mind; why are people afraid of the technological advent .
If we are to assume that technological progress and human imagination are two irreconcilable things, then we would imminently affiliate ourselves to the Romantic conceptions or even the Luddite attitude. This rage-against-the-machine phenomenon is on a par with primitive myth - making. Moreover, the trends which trigger this kind of attitude can even be traced back to a cheap horror story. Why? The answer here is fear - fear of the unknown. Just like Medusa in the myths of the ancient Greeks, the embodiment of ultimate evil, or even the gruesome monster in Bram Stoner's novel. These two examples both lead us to one and the same conclusion. People tend to generalize their fear in a flat black-and-white image. This also holds true for the stereotypes that have been built up to sum up the three-dimensional technological reality into a distorted one-dimensional concept. And what happens if this image is reduced to a terrifyingly intelligent machine which lurks the infinite paths of the informational highway? From this starting point it is not hard to jump to the conclusion that technologies may impair our mental abilities .
People are afraid of technological progress and claim that this threatens the human faculty. This is ludicrous, just as ludicrous as the primitive aggression of the Luddites on 19th century machinery. They believed that the machines are responsible for unemployment. Others believe that technology threatens to overpower their imagination. Unemployment than was due to mass migration to the cites. Deficiency of thought and lack of imagination is due to entirely personal characteristics .
As it was stated before, people are afraid of the unknown. It isn't hard for the half-informed to see a horrifying image of the near technologically wise future. But to think of a future world where machines are the decision-makers, where humans are reduced to mere walking extensions can hardly be acceptable with no amount of reasonable doubt. The reason why this can hardly be anticipated is the fact that the human mind is irreplaceable. It cannot become the author of its own creation. Whatever marvelous machinery is to be invented in the future, it will always be a byproduct inferior to the capacity of human imagination. What is more, imagination itself is so tightly intermingled with emotions that sometimes no distinct borderline can be drawn between the two. And emotions are often too subtle to be felt, let alone created .
People are sceptical about new technology because they are not equipped with the necessary knowledge to handle it. Being informed helps you avoid potential threats in using any technology, whether it be household appliances or sophisticated virtual reality products. This is analogous to driving a car wit or without a driving permit. Therefore, it is not knowing the rules of these man - made "tools" that is the cause for alarm. And a tool is simply a utility. It does not threaten to replace one's imagination. On the contrary, it helps both mind and imagination along the tortuous path of perfection .
Indeed, one must always have a "luddite" within him and not take things for granted. This is so, because like any revolution, the technological one has its aftermath. And it can be disasterous if the necessary precautions are not undertaken. But does that mean we have to shut our eyes to the blatant thruth and pretend that technologies do not exist? Besides, we have many other things to fear. You only have to turn on the eight o'clock news...
