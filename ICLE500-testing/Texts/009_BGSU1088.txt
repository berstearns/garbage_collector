Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
Most people go to university to prepare themselves for a future career or at least because they are interested in a particular area of study. To become specialists they need an academic education and in this sense the university is the only means by which they can achieve their goal .
In my opinion the degree they receive is essential for their future career .
Of course, the knowledge students have acquired should be put into practice after graduation. At this point some find out that their expectations do not match with the real world .
However, one should not rely entirely on the degree to cope with the situation. Experimenting, practice, learning from one's own mistakes is needed to suceed on the working place. These are things that one discovers for oneself and that cannot be taught. There is not such a degree which can fully prepare us for life. The best of educations will not help a person succeed if he or she is uncooperative but has to work in group. The degree is the background we need but it is us who have to learn how to cope with reality. That is why I think that university degrees are far from being worthless .
There are majors that can be called "more theoretical" than others. For example, studying Philosophy or History means studying mainly theory while Medicine involves a lot of practice. For some areas of study practice is much more important than in others and that is why we should not expect the same ratio practice:theory in each field. Moreover, the theoretical fields prepare students for the real world in a different way. By encouraging them to think critically, organise and express their thoughts orally or in written form, make comparisons and associations, use logic or imagination, they prepare them not only for their career but also for life as a whole. Those are qualities which are essential for managing even in the most difficult situations .
Many majors produce mainly teachers, lecturers, writers or just theoreticians. For these professions practice, too, is needed but a deep knowledge of theory is essential .
On the other hand, practical excercise is crucial for other fields of study like Performing Arts, Fine and Applied Arts, Dentistry, Computer Programming etc. There is no doubt that after graduation, a student in one of these fields will be well prepared for his or her future work .
However, even those majors can not do without theory. For medical students, for example, theoretical knowledge is no less important than practical skills .
The value of university degrees is not in their being theoretical or practical. In one way or another every academic education will help a student to cope better with the real life. The most important thing is that the graduates are good specialists in their field and intelligent, independly thinking, self-confident human beings .
