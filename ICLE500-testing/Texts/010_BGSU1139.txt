Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
Every intelligent young person dreams to graduate from the university one day. It seems to be the highest goal in most of the young people's lives. They do anything possible to become suitable applicants to a certain university. On the one hand the troubles they take are reasonable - after graduating you have more possibilities for a career; there are quite a lot of roads you can choose to walk along. You can even choose whether to walk or run. On the other hand, the things you study, especially here, in Bulgaria are so far away from reality that sometimes you forget what exactly your subject is .
Although it might sound too sophisticated, the University as an institution is a dream .
Before having the chance to be part of it your imagination makes it look like a dome. You fascinate about just teachers and friends; you dream of the hundreds tones of knowledge you are to get there but when the last thrill about you being a part of the Great Dome is gone, you feel as if you are on an entirely different planet. What is more - and entirely different HOSTILE planet .
Anyway, you suppose there is a kind of mistake... And you keep on hoping. Until one day you forget the subject you are studying. There are so many courses you have to take that there is no time left for the ones you like. You do not have time to read a single book, you do not have time to do your homework... But who cares! You have chosen to be there and dropping out is out of the question. But you keep on struggling. You fight for the right to learn. I, myself was extremely excited last year, when I was a First year student; on the one hand I was totally ruined physically and psychologically by everything I had to do, on the other hand I was absolutely pleased with the things I learned. This year I am able to see that most of the courses we have to take are so far away from reality, from anything that could happen to us, that I start to get amazed .
Everything is so theoretical and unintelligible that I have, subconsciously, begun to think of transferring to another university. But I know that this wouldn't change anything. There is no chance. There is no hope. The situation is the same in the universities all over the country. You get so much information, you loose so much of your time that after five years you feel like an old person - you remember things and faces but almost nothing from the nearly fifty exams you have passed because the information you have got has nothing to do with everyday life .
Anyway, you graduate as a specialist. But it turns out that you are an expert only according to he documents. Otherwise it is all the same as if you have not spent these five years in the Dome. You have learnt everything by heart; you know how it works but you cannot make it work, you cannot turn it on. Nothing has been said about turning on in the textbooks and grammars...
Despite everything I do not think that it is not worth studying in the University. On the contrary, you learn and become better informed but I believe that it would be much better if students had the chance to study real things and to get better-prepared for the real life and the real problems they will face after graduating .
