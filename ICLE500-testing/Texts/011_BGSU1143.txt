Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
I agree to a great extent with this statement and, especially with the part preceding the comma. I can talk, of course, out of personal experience most objectively but I think I can express as well the feelings of many students from other fields. These are people I have talked to about this partucular subject thus I have gathered their opinion .
Just before coming back home I met a friend of mine who after hearing I had to write this essay offered his assistance by giving me some ideas. He is a "freshly-cut" graduate from the University of Architecture in Sofia. What he said was that the topic of my essay was very precise in its determining the problem of their education. They studied piles of most probably useless information and data but did very little on the practical level. They did not attend the actual planning of a new building, park, stadium etc .
Another major problem this friend pointed out was the lack of updating students with the technological progress in the particular field of study or work. He says that now that he has graduated he has taken up a course in computers. At university, instead of using ready-made packets of computer programmes especially devised for the utilization of the architect's work, they studied programming which once again is obviously useless. Nobody is giong to create his own programme .
In the field of ceramics, for example, the problems are serious. The students' time is occupied by theoretical courses such as technology of clay, perspective, aesthetics, etc. but nobody teaches the students how to use the pottery wheel and how to whet on it. They are not taught either how to draw the different types of patterns that decorate the dishes .
In our department problems are similar. Instead of having as many contacts with native speakers as possible we take theoretical courses in syntax, semantics, morphology etc. We don't know how to use the vast number of English teaching computer programmes. We don't use any TV or VCR equipment to aid our education. To make the course more practical we could also increase the number of translation classes .
To sum up then problems seem to be quite the same in the different field of the higher education. To make the study more useful a balance should be reached where we are given just the necessary and important theory, thus leaving space and time for practical courses which prepare us for the actual face of the profession that we are to be confronted with in our "working future".
