Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 
 
Finance in our modern world plays the greatest role of all. As a matter of fact it deserves an Oscar for its performance so far. It reigns over all aspects of human life and society - money has become a vital part of our existence and we need it as desperately as we need air to breathe and sun and water to support our living .
The famous quotation: "Money makes the world go round!" sums up as briefly and accurately as possible the essence of human society today. A plain and well-known fact is that people are obsessed with money and this is no longer considered a mental disease as other obsession are but the normal state of human affairs. In the society that we have built our life depends wholly on the money - if you have it you will be well-off and you'll live, if you don't then you can expect only the worst .
So, logically here comes the question why some people have more money than others and there are such that have no money at all. It is not an easy question to answer but if we take the title to be the most justified answer that we can safely conclude that there is something very wrong in our society. In fact there is, it is exactly this unequality of rights and possibilities which makes the rich richer and the poor poorer .
Probably the decision of this problem must be careful and exact application of the title of this essay but then it appears quite difficult to estimate someone's contribution to society. This is such a subjective issue that it is almost impossible for extremely subjective creatures as ourselves to accomplish the task. If we manage to do this then all our problems will be solved .
Equality as a social issue has been one of the major problems in the human society for centuries .
Since the dawn of civilization, the human society has been structured and divided into levels, ranks, classes or whatever one likes to name them. And since then the struggle for equality has never seized .
But what exactly is equality and how has it been treated through time?
In the past centuries equality was understood more or less in terms of wealth and nobility. There were rich and poor, noble and ordinary people. Society was divided into classes and one was considered equal only toe the people belonging to the same class .
Nowadays, things inevitably have changed. Our society is still divided into classes although many people deny that. Moreover, more divisions have been made in terms of religion, sexuality and so on. However, people feel more equal than ever before. Not only because the gaps between the classes have become smaller but because today equality is a state of mind .
Today, the first part of Orwell's statement "All men are equal" is the basis of many constitutions and declarations for the human rights and all politicians claim that people are equal because they have been given equal opportunities to succeed in life. Perhaps there's some truth in that .
Perhaps today it is not so important who you are, where you come from, how rich you fee. It is what is in your mind that counts, not in your pocket .
However, there are people who cannot "feel equal and think equally". The paradox here is that the problem is not in their mind but in their pocket. Because in our money-driven world it is extremely hard to live, exist even, let alone think and feel. Many poor people are bound to struggle for their living and does not consider themselves equal in any way to a rich businessman, for example. It is not that they cannot think and feel, they are stupid or insane but because they are mentally suppressed by the injustice of their life. In this sense, Orwell's statement is still true today. Some people are more equal then others because they have or are given the ability to feel so. Perhaps, it is trues in milder terms but let's hope we will be able to change that .
