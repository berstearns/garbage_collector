Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 
 
Once the American president John Kennedy said something about the issue which will be discussed in this essay. His point was that one should not ask what the United Stated can do for them but what they can do for the United States. So, in the ideal situation one should contribute to the society they live in without expecting any reward at all. But as far as anyone has financial obligations, such as bills, rents, taxes, etc. this idea cannot be applied in real life. Besides, there is no living creature, at least not a human being, who can be made to work without and reward, whether it is financial or of some other kind. Of course, when stating this we should say that it refers to the present only it was not so long ago when slavery existed. Yet, slaves were at least given food, so even they got some kind of stimulation .
From the things mentioned above a very obvious conclusion can be drawn that in order to meet their needs people go to work and get a certain financial reward for the job they do. But here arises the more important issue of how much exactly should a person get for his or her contribution to society, or in other words who contributes more to society? Doctors or businessmen? At first sight it is clear that doctors should get the highest financial reward because there is no need to question their contribution to society, at all. But it is common knowledge that businessmen earn a lot more than doctors. However, this fact can be easily explained .
Businessmen are not paid by somebody else for their job. That is, they hind of personal reward themselves, so that is not a good example of fair distribution of remuneration. If we go back to the doctors again, it turns out that in some countries, particularly those of Eastern Europe, they get even less than skilled manual workers, whose job is not of primary importance to society but who work in the private sector, so if everything works right (which is often not the case in Bulgaria) the more they produce, the more they are likely to get as a financial reward. So, it turns out that the meaning of the word "contribution" has to be redefined for every particular society .
In addition, I would like to mention two more burning issues: pensions and women's payment, including child benefits. People who are retired evidently do not contribute much to the society, however they have done so far the most part of their lives and in my opinion, although they do not have the needs of a young person, they still deserve an honourable place in society. When mentioning women I mean that in some countries they are not equally paid with men even though they do exactly the same job. Besides, how can one estimate the contribution of a mother by paying her child benefits which are not enough even for a pair of baby's shoes .
To conclude with, people's financial reward is often not commensurate with their contribution to society. However, there was one tiny bit in the statement discussed. It says "the society they live in". So, it is not their fault if they live in the wrong society, that fails to provide them with what they really deserve .
