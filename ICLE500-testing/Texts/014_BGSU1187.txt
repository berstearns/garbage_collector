Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 
 
Before going into discussion of the topic it might be better to specify what exactly ' equal ' mean .
What do people understand by the word ' equal'? And by giving a clear definition it would than be easier to explain what we think about the statement and how true this is nowadays .
We live in a free country where you have the right to have your own point of view, to share your ideas with no fear what so ever. Therefore, even the meaning of a simple word requires your own opinion which varies from one person to another .
When we talk about people being "equal" what I personally imply in the meaning is that all people deserve the same rights as each other; they should have the same status; there should be no class division. But does this reality hold true today? To my opinion, the answer is ' no'. it is true hat we are all born equal, but what happens to us afterwords. Our lives take different directions, some live in luxury while others are on the other side of the line, wondering how to make it until the next day. The sad think is that if you are wealthy enough you can achieve all your goals although you may not deserve it. But if you are poor, if you cannot satisfy your needs no matter that you are clever you cannot develop as a person. You cannot achieve any progress in your life .
On the other hand, men can be equal but only before God and the law. God created us all the same and one day when our turn to stand before him comes he should than regard us a s equal .
No-one knows weather this is true or not but at least that is what the Bible teaches us .
"We are all equal before the law". The law is the same for everyone. But again if we stop and think more carefully about this statement we may spot certain gaps. Nowadays, we have witnessed how people who really deserve to be punished get away with it, and this arises yet another question: Is Temida blind? So, how can we say that all men are equal at all?
As I previously said to be equal people should be treated the same way with no exeptions what's so ever. But today there is no evidence in favour of this statement. I have tried to find even one but again, as it always happens, there is an exeption for everything. We have lived with that so far and we will continue this way as long as the world exists .
