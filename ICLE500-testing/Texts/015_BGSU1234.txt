Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
If we are to consider the practical application of the knowledge one has gained during one's years in university, the first think that we must consider is the career one has chosen. If this career has to do with scientific research or the profession of a teacher (no matter whether it is a school or university teacher) then the preparation universities offer might be of considerable help .
Otherwise university education does not, as a rule, make young people flexible when it comes to their professional realization .
Although university education tries to give a wither perspective in certain areas of the achievements of human thought and culture, it very often fails to provide suggestions as to how the information received may be used by the individual. In other words, students are sometimes too much preoccupied with what other people have thought or said without being given the chance to assist themselves in the complex system of human experience, although they too take an active part in a constant recycling of information. If at least a small part of what is thought at university does not coincide with a student's personal beliefs, then we come to the question whether we need university education at all .
Another aspect of university education, which sometimes terrified students very much, is suggested by the saying "The more I learn, the less I know. In fact this really is the case when it comes to learning: there appear more and more interesting, or important things, which seem to demand close attention and sometimes students feel lost in this flow of interconnected details .
Such on abundance does have its influence on personal motivation and most often this influence is negative .
Thus we come to considering the role of the teacher which is closely related to the curriculum in terms of focus on different aspects of the disciplines thought. Although students at universities are not little children, they still may be very strongly impressed and even influenced by someone else. An important thing teachers must not forget is that students are individuals and personalities on their own and what both teachers and students should have in mind when it comes to communication is mutual respect. In my opinion, a very important thing about the process of education is the atmosphere of cooperation which is closely connected with overcoming certain difficulties (together) on the way of reaching s set goal. If teachers themselves are not convinced that what they do is what they want, or at least what should be done, then students cannot be convinced and motivated at all. Thus the years spent in university become a mere waste of tine and students are not given any idea of their own importance and potentials when it comes to intellectual achievements or just the satisfaction of a well-done job .
Actually, what makes university education of little value is not only the curriculum, but also the fact that students seldom get the right perspective of viewing the world in its complexity, no matter whether on the base of technical disciplines or the humanities .
