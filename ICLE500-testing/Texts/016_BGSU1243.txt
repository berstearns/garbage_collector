Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 
 
The question of equal opportunities for all has been very topical over the last few decades in the West, and the problem is beginning to gain momentum in our own country nowadays. Yet, it is interesting to note that the movement started in the USA as a backlash against the century-long oppression of the blacks. Which leads one to certain speculations - whether it is possible at all for everyone to have equal opportunities or this is just the next product of American hypocrisy and utopian thinking. In my humble opinion, the latter is the case - because people are not born equal and they are not raised in the same way, the result being that everyone is unique, and different from all the rest. And if equal opportunity be given to everyone, that would mean propping up the less competent and restricting the more able .
If we start from the very beginning and go as far back as birth, it would perhaps be less obvious that people are unique. And yet, however alike babies might look, they are never the same. As crude as it may sound, their genetic material is different, and that's a major part of who you are .
After all, your genes predetermine most of your future "parameters" such as potential looks, potential IQ, potential health and what not .
Then, who you become very much depends on your parents and the choices they make - who they are and what connections they have, how they bring you up and what opportunities they give you in terms of social environment, schooling, health care and so on. As a result, even identical twins are not the same person although they have the same genes. The uniqueness of everyone is not a racist or Faschist idea as some claim, it is a fact. And it stands to reason that you don't provide the same opportunities to people with different abilities. Race and nationality would seem to be excluded from the list, at least it would be logical, but experience show a different thing .
While it is only sensible to discriminate against people who are incompetent - because if you need an employee or a partner in business then they have to be the right person and quality for the position - it is only a prejudice to discriminate against people, or groups of people as it might be, on the basis of race or nationality. And however illogical this is, we know that the West, and the States in particular do that all the time, although they wouldn't admit it openly .
It seems to me that the most striking example of this is what happens in the admission offices of their colleges - though very few would actually say so, most of them have quotas for racial groups and for international students. Then, there are special scholar-ships awarded to minority groups - and that's discrimination as obvious as anything, only this time it is against the white people. And there's thousands things like this, official and everything, although contrary to the general appeal for equal opportunities .
So I would ask these American gentlemen if they would please keep their hypocrisy to themselves. I'd give discrimination the thumbs up, but only as long as it is based on sensible criteria, that are actually relevant, and not on things like I'm black, you are white. I'm tall and you're short, I'm American and you're a Pole. These are a part of who we are, but it's important that we order our priorities and judge people on the relevant points .
