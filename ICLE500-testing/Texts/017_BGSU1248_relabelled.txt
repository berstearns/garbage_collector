Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value.
 
The first thing I would say when reading this statement is: "I don't agree." On second thoughts, however, I find much ground for this position. The fact is that I am at the university right now and I am doing all these theoretical courses. They are not a grudge for me although I realize that they keep me away from real life to a very large extent. I see the pros and cons, but I'm doing this because I feel like doing it .
Doing theoretical courses needs a lot of time and effort but, to my mind, the result is quite satisfying. I have always believed that you can learn to cook at any time. We need something to make us stand out from the poorly or not at all educated. What we gain at the university will open many doors in the long run. It will always be an advantage. Someone has said that education is what is left after what has been learned has been forgotten. To me, education is an unarguable asset in real life .
On the other hand, many will ask whether what remains is enough to give us the security in a world of people with practical experience. We can be taken aback by the impossibility to apply our abstract knowledge to the world of material things. If, for example, I meet someone I went to school together with and he tells me he has build a house, has a wife and two nice kids, works for a very rich company and is planning a trip around Europe for the summer, that would be like a cold shower for me .
Aren't these 4 or 5 years at the university really a loss of time? I have heard many times among colleagues the following words: "How do I write a formal request?" or "What do I write here?",
when filling in some kind of application. There are numerous examples of what we don't know how to do. A strong counter example would be using catalogues in libraries .
To sum up, I think that there is a lot that can be changed in theoretical courses at the university. It would be much better if they have a practical use for students. But, as a whole, education is of primary importance and indisputable value .
