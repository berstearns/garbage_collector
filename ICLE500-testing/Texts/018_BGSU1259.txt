Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
Imagine yourself not taking an university degree. What will your future be like? Working as a shop assistant, a taxi driver or ...? I wonder if this will make you feel satisfied .
So what? As it turns out, you're left with very little choice indeed? That is why you go to university, spend another four or five years of your life there - and then you are ready to come face to face with life that crushes and smashes. For most people nowadays tend to look on university degrees as the stepping-stone to success. What you study is not so important. Nor what you get. What matters in this case is the diploma - the precious leaflet that is believed to be the key of many locked doors. Is it really so?
Reality tells a different story. During the years one spend at the University, one really learns a lot .
It is true that most of the time you've got the feeling that your head is constantly being filled up with heaps of useless information. It is also true that you spend many a sleepless night in desperate attempts to somehow absorb all this stuff - to cram it into your brain just for the sake of the exam, and the moment the exam is over, forget all about it. This is definitely a crack in the system, you must confess. It would undoubtedly be better of students were somehow made to study throughout the year - not just at the end of it, when session begins to haunt their dreams .
But such changes are a matter of years .
And here comes the question: what dos the university give you and what does it take? No doubt it takes a lot - maybe more that it gives. Your free time, your freedom and carelessness. And in a way it robs you of your previous self. Slowly but inexorably you change. You grow up to take responsibilities, to realize who you are, what you want from life and how to achieve it. And this is not little at all. It is not only due to the university, it is up to you above all. But it can not be denied that the university too is a major factor in this process of self-development .
As far the theoretical side - well, it is always there. And perhaps it will always be. And still you can really learn a lot from a single exam only - provided you know what to take and how to take it. What is more important is that during all these years of studying, taking exams and so on - you become mature - and ready to face life. The real life .
