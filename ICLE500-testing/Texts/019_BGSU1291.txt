Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 
 
When God made the human race he made all the humans equal, Equal in their possessions, minds, absolutely everything. But I guess that when God mixed the mixture he put a wrong ingredient too without noticing. And it spoiled everything, it transformed into a flow of the first men. Then he condemned us and it was inherited by the following generations .
As a whole we the humans are a cursed race. It is deeply rooted in us to kill, to steal, to lie .
Sooner or later it all comes out. We've been living on that planet for thousands of years now but there are certain things which will never change. One of them is the evil rooted in us. George Orwell was right because he was writing what he was seeing, he was writing reality. The present time is not much different from the time before two hundred years for instance. The bad people have always been bad and the good people have always been at the bottom. This is mostly true today in the 21st century when the driving force behind every person is the personal success at the expense of the others. Well, almost every person. The people who think only of their wealth think they are something more than the others, they think they can do whatever they want - these are the people we call "more equal".
Orwell's comparison of humans to animals is perfectly adequate. Because what are we? We are claimed to be the highest animal kind. Like them we are often guided by the instinct of self - preservation which makes us do bad things to others. Makes us neglect others, betray them, hurt them. When we follow that instinct we are blind for everything else but our survival. Another reason that makes people think they are "special" is money. Yes, the powerful money. They can put a man high in the clouds and block his common sense. When a person has money they think that the world is their, that it belongs to them. And what happens when they get a lot of money?
They become the world's best creatures. And want more and more money, this is loftiness and arrogance come from, from their sense of superiority and importance .
Yet another reason would be if a person has a right social position. For instance, a congressman, a TV journalist, a rich banker. They watch people from above. The "special", "more equal people" are everywhere, there isn't a certain place where they could be found, they are all around us. Of course, there are people who don't have any basis for their arrogance and "speciality".
Yes, Orwell couldn't has been more right than. People are cruel, they kill each other, they destroy their lives. And this is because one thinks that is more than the others. it's hard time we live in and everyone tries to play their role in this life neglecting the others .
