Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 
 
All men are equal. It is presumed that God made them so. Still all throughout the history of his species man have fought for equality. It has turned out that indeed some men are more equal than others. at least socially. And that is quite naturally .
All men cannot be equal. Each one of us is born with different capacity of mind and heart, at different places, under different conditions. Some have more wits or are more open-hearted than others, some have loving parents and a happy childhood, others do not. Some were born with a certain position in society which have secured them better opportunities for education, professional realization, personal or social success, for achieving their goals. Some were handicapped by the conditions of life under which they were born from their first breath of air to the last beat of their heart, entangled in a cruel reality, fighting for every piece of bread in order to keep living just to be able to go on fighting .
Some like their inherited position of life, others do not. Some conform it, others rebel. Some fight for equality, others for a higher status to be more equal than the others .
All men cannot be equal. Not each of us want to have the same conditions of life, opportunities or privileges as the others, some want better ones. Some want to be rich. The some money from the rich, give it to the poor and then we all shall be equal and happy. But there will always be someone who will wish to have more money, to be more equal .
Some want to have social power. Give more civil rights to the oppressed, restrict the influence of the powerful and we again shall be equal. But shall we be powerful? Over what and, most of all, over whom shall we exert our power? Here comes the need of unequality. There have to be oppressed to make the others feel powerful. Moreover, being influential and having power is not easy as it seems .
All men cannot be equal. That is just an utopia. A beautiful dream cherished in the hearts of generations of men throughout the centuries. Our life is based on inequality. Society, even nature is based on inequality. Some say that life is a jungle. In the jungle one cannot afford themselves to be weak and unfit. If one is not strong enough, they simply perish. The stronger need the weaker to live on them. It is the best that survive. The most equal one. There should be death to secure life. There is life owing to inequality. Inequality produces the fittest, the ones who survive .
It makes the world turn and the social system work .
Inequality is recognized and accepted by men. What else is the evolutionary theory about the survival of the fittest than a rejection of equality. If all were equal who would have survived.? All of us?
Still men are fighting for equality. The idea of it lies in the foundation of one of the most powerful social ideologies - socialism. And its realization proved that even among equal there are some that are more equal. It is inevitable .
