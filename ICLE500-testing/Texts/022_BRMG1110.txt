Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
This issue carries an important meaning if we consider that dreaming and imagination are embodied in human nature. There are different opinions about it, for example, some people think that technology has improved our imagination. This essay will consider that dreaming and imagination have decreased in front of the advance of technology and industrialization and therefore our skills related to those aspects have been damaged . 
Dreaming carries a great deal of importance in human nature. If we consider that technology and industrialization have reduced our power of dreaming, we can say that our nature has been damaged. Dreaming is concerning more about the future than about the past and that is why human nature has lost most of its creative power. Without dreaming there is no prospect of future, and then people live just for the present, clung to the boundaries of a world without dreams. And dreams play an indispensable role in our lives, since they give us reasons for living and fighting for our plans. Furthermore, dreaming teaches us to be resolute in our actions, to pursue our objectives . 
When it concerns imagination, technology and industrialization have decreased this power belonged to the human nature. Nowadays we have on the Internet everything we need without any effort; this fact contributes to the self-indulgence and to the shortage of imagination. People nowadays do not need to be creative since they have at hand everything. Instead of creating things, they look for on the Internet . 
Both dreaming and imagination have an important role in our lives, they go together well and increase our power to create and improve things. Without them human nature is limited to works already done, leaving no room for creation. We need them, inasmuch as we need to be creative in the work environment; there is no success without the effort to bring into light new ideas and dreams. And once technology and industrialization have reduced our power to do things by ourselves, we can consider that, beyond the benefits which both of them have brought to humanity, they have as well brought damages. The capacity of dreaming has been reduced, the power of imagination has been trimmed. The losses with the advent of technology and industrialization play out in full view of humanity. We live on technology and industrialization, not leaving room for dreamers and creators . 
In conclusion, if it is true that technology and industrialization have brought benefits to humanity, it is also true that both of them have brought jeopardies which have limited the human nature, i.e., we are losing our power of dreaming and our capacity for imagination. The consequences can be dangerous, since we have people focused on the present without caring about their future, since we have people with the power of imagination reduced, losing thus their ability to create things. We live nowadays on the edge of human nature, we need to be conscious of what damages technology and industrialization have brought to us in order to improve ourselves and shun a collapse in our nature .
