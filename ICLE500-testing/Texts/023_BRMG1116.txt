Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Going to university is most peoples dream and they rely on this opportunity to get a great job and to be well succeeded in their professional lives. At first, there is the dilemma of choosing the right career. After a long and hard way, the course is chosen, but the university is not. Then it is time to select the university among a range of options. When this is done, the next step is to study as hard as someone can to do the entrance examinations. Unfortunately, after all this effort, the student can get frustrated when the university does not live up to his expectations. It usually happens not only because of a badly structured pedagogical plan, but also because of the lack of opportunities to get experience before graduating . 
The excitement of going to college makes the student feels full of energy to start learning about everything. He attends seminars, takes part in special projects, and spends lots of time in the library. But, after some time, he finds that some difficult and essential subjects were very superficially studied, whereas a lot of time was spent on less complex topics. A deeper analysis of specific contents would make him more familiar with the field. In addition to this defective time management, it is also common to conclude at the end of the course that if some subjects had been studied before others, it would have been easier to learn the whole thing. The order the subjects are taken interferes the way the student learn. An effective pedagogical plan is crucial to have a god quality learning process . 
If a bad academic structure is combined with no opportunities for real practice, things can get even worse. When a student keeps studying, but there is no chance to see in loco how things really work, it will probably be very difficult for him to become a good professional. By the time a student finishes college, he must be ready, at least, to perform fundamental practices of his occupation. Otherwise he will be an intern with a college degree for a long time before getting more confident. Every student must have opportunities to deal with real situations in a daily basis, especially from the second half of the course on . 
It is known that a lot of renowned universities have helped hundreds of thousands of students to develop their knowledge and become excellent professionals. However, on the other hand, it is also possible to find poorly structured universities that keep on forming professionals who are not well prepared for the market force due to too much theory and too little practice. Students spend their time, money and energy in a four, five or even six-year course in order to get a good job and keep on improving their skills. Thus, there should be a very rigorous government inspection to guarantee a minimum level of excellence in education, so that there would not be a great difference in terms of knowledge and practice when comparing graduates from different educational institutions .
