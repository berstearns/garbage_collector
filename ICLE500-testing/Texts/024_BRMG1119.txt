Most university degrees are theorical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value . 
I think that there are a lot of universities that don't make the necessary role that is to prepare the profissional to enter to job market. The students begin in the school with a dream. They believe that they will go out the school with a profession and they will gain a lot of much money . 
Sometimes, the parents will not buy important things to their family to put their sons in the better schools. They believe that the study would be the solution to all problems. Sometimes the student can stay disappointed. Unfortunatelly, we live in a society where a lot of people still think that the certificate is more important than all others things in the life. I don't think that the study is not important but I think that it is not vital . 
Today, there are a lot of Universities graduating people, but there are not enough work to every these people. The graduation will not help people to get a work. There are a lot of people that know how to embroider, to sew, people that work in the field planting our food. There are millions of people that know to do many kinds of works that are very important to our life even not being in the universities curriculum . 
without never have been in a university. But, as long as the certificate more important, these people don't have the value that they deserve . 
The teacher besides not being valorized, is still a good example of how the learning university is rather theorical. When we go out the school, we think that we are ready to teach our students. We think that it will be easy because we are profissional, we have our certificate . 
But the frustration is big, when we begining our work. We are alone in front of the class with fourty different pupils. Each one with different personality, different knowledge. This moment, you realize that we don't know to do this. Which procedure take? The university don't teach us what to do in front of situations that will appear. Each situation is unique and we have to be resolved. This situation could happen in all jobs, because surprises always happen and especially when we work with humans . 
In the university we have opportunity to learn some subjects as Methodology, Sociology, Psychology that can help us to live better together with other people and to do a new graduation in future. The university can offer us a base and a part of knowledge, but is necessary we will continue to learn a few more every day and we will adquire the experience only with time . 
But we can not say that the university certificate is not important. Despite the university do not prepare us for the real world, it can help us . I think that depend of us. If we will have interest in learningand work it is sure that we can be excellent profissionals .
