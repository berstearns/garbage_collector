Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Which person has not seen another one acting inappropriately in his or her professional area? It is very common to see professionals doing wrong things in their jobs, although these people have studied in university courses. Getting a degree in most of the universities . 
does not mean a person has learnt everything necessary about how to act and work in the real world . 
In the educational area, for instance, it might be said that each student should give their best to get as much as possible from the academic world he or she is into. Many people claim there are different kinds of students and for that reason there are different types of professionals. It is claimed that some students are more interesting in learning; other ones simply have a medium development throughout the under-graduation period. However, even the best student of a class may not have everything he or she needs to put the abilities learnt inside class into practice if the university chosen by that student is not qualified enough. It is possible to see some teachers, or even professors, who do not have any didactics at all. Even though they have got a teaching degree, and have also had teaching method classes, their way of teaching seems not to match the students way of learning. Some universities, who form these teachers or professors, are not capable of offering a good quality teaching course. They do not research enough; neither they are open to the modern discoveries about different didactics . 
It can be stated that the practical experience is only gotten through a lot of years in one specific profession. However, universities should be the places where real life is reproduced. Still making use of the same example, the courses involving teaching degrees, should consider, for instance, amid many other issues, the inclusion of people with audio disabilities. Unfortunately, many universities are not taking them into consideration. An under-graduate student may learn how to teach, however he or she might not learn the sign language, neither might they learn about the importance of having this minority of people in the same class as people who are able to hear normally. And when these students graduate and face real world in schools, they are not prepared to treat these special people. And this is not something one can get only through professional experience. Actually, before having had any contact with a def student, a teacher should be ready to work, knowing how to deal with the necessities of his or her special student . 
In conclusion, there are few universities that can really prepare students for the real life of society needs. As it is difficult to change institutions like a university, a student should realize the importance of his or her graduation according to real world, and chose the best universities to ingress. The educational area is a good parameter to notice that even if a person has got a degree in a university, it is not enough for him or her to be prepared to face the practical world of the professional chosen by him or her. But if there were a bigger involvement between theoretical and practical world, it should reach all types of courses in the universities .
