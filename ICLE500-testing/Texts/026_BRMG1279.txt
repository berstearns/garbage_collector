Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Since the beginning of the humanity history, at least the history that is studied at the schools along the country, we can clearly notice that we live on a constant fight for power. Much of what is behind this power is related to money, and naturally who has money, has power as well . 
We have learned that in the old Rome, they fought for land, the more land they conquered the more people they had under their control and as a consequence the Empire got bigger and bigger spreading the race of Cesar, as much as they could, around the world. Jesus knew what was behind a simple coin which represents money and power so that he showed that it wasn't what he was searching, in the contrary, he wanted to leave the money for those whom wanted to fight for that, to whom were willing to die for that, to the false people who search power and control behind richness and that's why he spread love as a way of life. Unfortunately it was the ruin of his life but fortunately because of his death and his reasons he is still remembered today and I'd say forever . 
Behind a slogan of a pure race, Hitler convinced millions of Germans to kill and if it were possible, to exterminate completely from the world the race of the Jewish. Isn't it a big coincidence that they were one of the richest people in the world?, couldn't he support all Germany alive by taking the Jewish money and richness during his war? His plan was quite simple. He convinced his people that their race was superior, the Jewish were inferior so they needed to be exterminated, of course and consequently Germany would keep their money. This money would keep them in the war and they would end up victorious on an episode that is considered one of the most tragical, violent, bloody, sad and so on, in our history and what was behind all this pain, the bloody money. The amount of money in gold deposited in the swiss bank with the suastic is something incredible. Will it be delivered to their real owners? This is what is planned, we just hope that they don't fight again for this to happen . 
In the middle east they have been fighting for at least 2,000 years. Though it's said that it's an ideological fight, power is behind their ideal as well. They can't put up with each other's ideal and so they kill each other but it happens that the most powerfull submits the others and who is the most powerfull?, the one who got more money. Again we see episodes of suffering because of money . 
Here in Brazil we live with it every day. People kill for less than a hundred real. Killers have different prices according to who they are going to murder. We hear on the news everyday cases of people who fools the others to get some money, sometimes the other is even a brother, a father, or a close relative of the person who is being fooled. I myself heard a report where the person said on the to the other who he had fooled; "I'm sorry to have done this to you, but we have to do it to live". The person in case had bought a car by the newspaper but never received the car or the money back . 
Money can change (as drugs do) the personality of a person. The riches want to get more rich, no matter what they have to do in order to it. They've got good salaries but even thus they risk their integrity and steal public money even to eat. We see doctors who don't assist serious pacients because they don't have money to pay. A good example for this is when we see on the TV people collecting money to save a person or a child on an important surgery . 
Perfect would be when people are developed enough to create a society where money doesn't exist. There was a time when it happened. A long time ago people exchanged services, benefits and material goods without the presence of money . 
If you needed a doctor, you just went to a doctor, if you needed food, you picked it up on the nearest grocery but of course you would be responsible for any kind of service. I guess this society is each time more difficult to happen because of the presence of the money. The powerful people got so powerful that they would not agree with this proposition and then, more war for peace. That's way I totally agree that "money is the root of all evil".
