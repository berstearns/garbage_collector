Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Recently, a research about the television was done in the United States of America. It discovered that most of people spend hours of their lives watching television. Men watch television about forty hours a week and women about twenty. It means that men watch television almost six hours a day and women more than two hours . 
People, around the world, need the television, and if they need even a little bit of this every day, they are dependents. It became a "drug" in their lives and it's gonna be proved here. The television is accompanying the people's way of life since its invention (1928). 
When the industry of "media" discovered the power of this means of communication, it began to use the television to rebuild people's way of thinking, creating shows, soup operas, novels, movies, etc. and commercials in-between that have told watchers what to do, what to wear, and who to be ever since . 
The more the television became fashion the more people went to the market to purchase the way of life it preaches. But the sad part of this is that people have done so, more and more unconsciously . 
Nowadays the TV has became inseparable part of our lives, and generation after generation has born in the TV era, thus we no longer judge its use anymore, although we should, especially for our children. We have grown up taught by the TV set and we have never stopped just a bit to think if these things showed off in TV are respectable and decent to help building our children's personality . 
Most of these children of yesterday are us today, and the reader shall agree with this: that nobody notices how much TV is inserted in this society context, and it appears like a conjunctive tissue to fill the holes of the main tissue of our lifetimes, and, as it was told here in the beginning, alarming amounts of time have been spent in front of the TV set, therefore, two important things have emerged from this: the former is that our way of life hasn't been doing so fine, the major part of our society, the masses, has been put into forced laziness situations (unemployment, poverty, general discouragement) that end up substituted by something; and the latter is that all the things one uses tp skip from these "forced situations" (not to face life) are called drugs, and TV watching fits it. So, the television's become a drug; an opium of masses that dopes everybody to have not to face the reality, while it recreates an "would-be reality" to please the watcher. When the watcher is already addicted it starts to suck him/her, inducting her/him to spend money, time, space of his/her life...! It can be qualified as a very powerful and hazardous drug, but nobody realizes it! The worst drug is the one that is used and present without revealing its real identity. Let's see the drinking, for instance, even everybody knows it is addictive, it conquered a certain acceptance and tolerance even by the law, so it's found all around normally. The TV is much worse, because the society doesn't even calls it a drug, perhaps because it's been suiting all of its purposes . 
So, meanwhile the television keeps destroying whole homes by "re-formatting" the time which people should get together into a lazy seat on the sofa, with no talking not to interfere with the "video-dialogue", we may let here a question in the air: wouldn't these sexual and violent behaviour of our youth nowadays a consequence of letting our children be taught by TV instead of us?
