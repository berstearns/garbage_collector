Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Our society has changed over the last centuries and thanks to the science technology development and industrialisation we have a better standard of living. Consequently people have become more materialistic and have forgotten the basic principles to live happily. Therefore there has never been a place for dreaming in our society as today and people are more interested in reading and imagining how the perfect world would be . 
In our modern world people don't have much time to spend as they like. Our lives are unquestionably better if we take in consideration the material standard of living but most of our time is spent in a stressful way. The process of modernization has affected the lives of individuals and it could be affecting positively if modern society were interested in abating poverty, inequality and ignorance, for example. However, it's not our main concern. The number of hours worked is gradually increasing because people are interested in making money to spend as the elite dictates. Unfortunately most individuals don't set value on remarkable things and getting new appliances in the market and paying for unnecessary surgeries are the present concerns . 
Despite the several achievements human beings agree that some aspects of the ancient societies were better than ours. Because of it there is the surprising fact that people want to bring back the looks of the past by reading about them. They are interested in documentaries and movies about primitive tribes, the old civilizations and also by alternative life styles too. It makes us conclude that human beings have become dreamers in order to compensate our sad reality . 
Authors who have written self-help books are famous and also the imaginative ones who make people believe in a world where everything is great. Everybody knows it's not a way of changing the society but it's certainly much easier to imagine the ideal world than to make it comes true. Being attracted by an utopia is a way of forgetting the civilization problems. Hence, the science technology and the industrialization have attracted peoples attention to literatures which give them the opportunity to dream . 
Once many are looking for another type of life it make us believe that people are becoming aware of the fact that not everything is okay and that its the time to the world undergo change. The first important step is to realize that there are problems which we have already done. We are definitely getting closer and closer to the answer to our difficulties. Imagining is not the answer but it's comforting to know that human being have not lost their faiths that better days will come and continuous to dream .
