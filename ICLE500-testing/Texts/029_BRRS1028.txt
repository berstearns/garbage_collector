Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
There are few topics so much linked to modernity and our contemporary tradition as the discussion of the role of women in society. Throughout the years, the feminists struggled against the domination of patriarchal models imposed on women, many times fighting as fiercely as they could to have their voices heard. Harsh, biting positioning and attitudes of these women have been regarded as a step back for the building of a relationship of equality among sexes. Many people truly believe feminists as a groups have done more harm then good to the cause. However, one can draw their own conclusions by observing how far the fight for fairness has advanced and the achievements of women since the movement started to grow in power, despite some minor misunderstandings on their way . 
One does not need to be a History expert to get in contact with the conditions under which women had been kept in traditional society; a brief look at history books or novels is enough to bring to the mind of the contemporary female the mistreatment and disregard towards women. The first feminists lived through the hardest conditions for a male dominated society could never be possibly open to dialogue and changes. It is easy to find historical examples of legendary feminine characters who directly raised their voices against the submission and limitations imposed to them and were severely punished and scolded. Women who dared to confront the patterns often received unsympathetic to say the least treatment. No wonder then, feminists at the very beginning of their organization as a movement had to take extreme actions not only to protect themselves from the rebukes of society, but also to create a sort of power that allowed them to be heard . 
The achievements of feminists are visible. Every woman that is allowed to write, choose a partner, decide whether to have children or not, drive, work and go to college should keep in mind that none of these freedoms came to them out of waiting and passive action. It is true that feminism brought with it natural risks of extremism and ideas that deviated from the original purposes proposed by the first feminists; on the other hand, it also made possible for women to advance so much that many should think it as a necessary evil, if so . 
Through a modern perspective, many have criticized the movement of feminism for its excessive combativeness against males and their straight tolerance. The image of a bitter, unloved, unwomanly woman stridently bashing men and everything slightly masculine is probably the image that prevails for many people every time feminism is brought into question. As it hold true for some representatives of the groups, it is certainly not this grumpy female who is the best portray of the movement which gained respect and rights for women all over the world. This stereotype of a hysterical feminist activist contributes very little to the real amplitude of the achievements feminists had to offer society. Many women sacrificed a good deal of their personal lives and concerns to the greater good . 
Even if some of the most combative feminists really contributed to create an atmosphere of competition and inequality sometimes even hostility between men and women, it can be tranquility taken as a mild pitfall on the long path of struggles courageous feminist activists took for the good of all women all around the globe. In a nutshell, there are undoubtedly those who affirm feminists had done more harm than good to the cause; nonetheless, a careful observer can refuse this affirmation by taking a look at the long list of realizations performed by these women at the cost of their private lives and interests .
