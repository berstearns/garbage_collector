Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Unlike people tend to believe, the Feminist Movement has existed since biblical times. The Old Testament mentions that the five daughters of a man who had died claimed for their right to his inheritance instead of their uncle. They claimed Why should the name of our father be omitted from among his family because he had no sons? Give us a possession among our fathers brother. Thousands of years have passed and the struggles have been persistent. Women are still establishing their position within society. But at what cost? 
It is unquestionable that the Womens Movement contributed a great deal to strengthen women's rights. Before the rise 
of the movement women were not aloud to elect or be elected in local elections. Moreover, they had no right to own any property: it would belong either to their father or to their husband. Some were not allowed to work or wear pants because that would be inappropriate behavior for a lady . 
However, being entitled to the same rights as men was not enough to the feminists, who claim that not only should women have the same rights, but also no gender differences should be considered at all. Having the same rights is not a synonym for behaving or being equal. It should only mean that these differences will not be used as excuses to discriminate one another . 
As a result of this lack of boundaries, the Womens Movement did not consider the inner differences that exist between man and woman. Science has already proved that the males brain works and reacts in a distinct way from the females. And instead of valuing and developing what each gender has of best, the movement tries to ignore genetics . 
Therefore, women assumed many male jobs in order to prove their capability while man made no efforts to take on female responsibilities. It generated three main consequences to the modern woman. The first one is the postponement of motherhood, which can lead to infertility and increase the probability of abnormalities in the fetuss formation. The second result is full-time jobs: women not only work regularly but also have to take care of their homes and children, most of the time with no help from their partners. It raises stress levels, and, consequently, the occurrence of illnesses and also creates tensions within the relationship between the woman and her family. Finally, it created a contingent of well-succeeded single women. Most men are not ready to date women more powerful than them and with better salaries than theirs. Even considering this kind of sexist behavior, the problems still persist: women do not want to remain single but they just can not find a partner . 
In short, the Feminist Movement has done a great job in relation to women's rights. But we should reflect on the results of some of its claims, as some of them did more harm than good to women. Instead of accusing Harvard's president Lawrence Summers of being sexist, the movement should analyze the ideas behind his words. It should keep defending women but also take into consideration that gender differences are innate and can be better exploited so as to act on their own behalf .
