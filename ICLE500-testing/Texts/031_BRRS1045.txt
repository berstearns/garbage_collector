Title: In the words of the old song, "Money is the root of all evil"
 
In a capitalist society, where money is the fuel responsible for the functioning of this big engine, it is not surprising that it is also the main cause of all violence, and even in general terms, that money is the root of all evil, as it is said in the old song. People are moved by the goal of earning more and more money, many times, regardless what they may have to do in order to achieve it. This way, money has become the reason for evil in small as well as in large proportions. From robbery to war, evil has been mostly caused by peoples eagerness in pursuit of money either direct or indirectly . 
It is broadly known by anyone who lives in a big city and it is obviously the main filling of newspapers, radio and television broadcasts, that violence has been largely motivated by economic reasons. What is worth mentioning is that not only upper or middle class citizens are victims of violence because of money, but that low class citizens suffer with the same kind of violence as well. Evil may assault poor people in the form of robbery, for instance, from which not even they are free of. Among the poor, robbery mostly happens at buses and at the dangerous streets of their equally poor neighborhood. These citizens have their already few and hard earned belongings such as watches, mobile phones, shoes and engagement rings taken away from them by robbers who most of the times sell the robbed belongings with the exclusive intention of getting money to buy drugs for their own use. But it is true that there are also robbers who commit small crimes as a means of providing food and other kind of essential things to their families, what is not an excuse, but yet, seems to be much more reasonable. The type of violence that usually assaults the rich, on the other hand, involves the suppression of larger amounts of money through the breaking into houses and kidnappings, for instance. It does not matter if it happens to the poor or to the rich. The fact is that these are all violent actions that involve serious psychological terror and may end up causing trauma in the name of money . 
Turning the spotlight to a much bigger proportion we can discuss the cases of evil deeds being directed by the leaders of whole nations aiming at the destruction of other nations. The word is war. It does not matter the excuse officially presented. It does not matter if it is said to be a war against terrorism or in the name of God. We can always identify economic interest behind such excuses. In a capitalist world, economic power is what defines the power of a nation. Worldwide leaders of nations try hard to increase the power of that nation they rule, and some get to the extreme point of starting wars and killing masses of innocent people in order to gain power . 
In summary, we can conclude that living in a capitalist society represents a strong reason for money being responsible for so many evil acts. Violence is broadly caused, in different proportions, due to peoples blind pursue for power and as a consequence, for what determines ones power in a capitalist world, that is money .
