Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
This line was said by the American singer and songwriter Billy Corgan in one of his songs with his band The Smashing Pumpkins. Many times, this is the exact feeling that people have in relation to the modern world in which we are living nowadays. It seems that our world sucks our time, our pleasures, our capacity to think and analyse information since it all comes in such a fast way. And that is the reason that makes so many people wonder where the dreams fit in our rushed lives . 
However, if on one hand it is possible to see people simply taken aback by the speed and modernity of our times and forgeting about their own lives and dreams, on the other hand, this is exactly what some other people need to trigger their imagination. One thing is for sure: modernity is coming as a rocket and cannot be changed. So, why not make the best of it? This positive philosophy is what moves people to use their creativity at the most. These people have the ability to take something that is seen as negative by the majority of people and turn it into something not only good, but creative, hopeful and imaginative . 
I think I fit in this second category of people: the optmistics. I strongly disagree with the statement that affirms that there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination. There is certainly room for both in our lives, even though they may be rushed as previously mentioned. But you have to find room in yourself to dream and imagine, and many are those who just cannot do it very well. It is necessary to forget about the outside world and look inside for a while, as if you were making a pause of everything else that doent concern you and your dreams. Dreams are what make people move on with their lives. If it wasn't for that, where would we find reason to keep on going on? Where would we find motivation not to give up? 
Fortunately, many people are just like me: dreamers. In my opinion, it is almost impossible not to dream. Some dreams are totally unrealistic and their dreamers know that they will never come true. But even these dreams are good for us, we use our imagination, develop our creativity and even laugh with the absurds that we wish. Some other dreams are totally possible to become reality. They may not be easy to achieve, but if you go for it and fight for your wishes they might come true . 
It might seem a little crazy from my part, but I really believe that even the world in which we live the world that is blamed for our lack of dreams just got where it is now because somebody dreamed of it. All the scientic experiments and technological devices that are totally common today, didn't exist before and have only become alive because somebody used his/her imagination, and struggled to make them real. So, to sum up, dreams are what make the world goes round and is something that is inside us, something that we just can't deny. Even if the world doesn't allow us much time to dream, we always find a way to do it!
