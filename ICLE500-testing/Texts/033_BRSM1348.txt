Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
When the word feminism appeared, people experienced a different reality - considering the fact it happened during the nineteenth century in the United Kingdom and the United States. The consequences of the movements which have taken place back at that time have really caused changes and what we currently have is actually a completely different world, but the question is: has it changed for the best? 
In fact, for a long period of time mens and women's roles were very well defined and now people are going through a huge role change. Even though this change is not as global as it could be, its worldwide influence can be easily observed. In Japan, the group (wether a family or a society as a whole) is greater than the individual and this means a particular woman must follow the old rules based on Confucianism and Buddhism both combined with the military class, which is basically look upon her husband as if he were heaven itself. On the other hand, in South Africa, divorced men claim maintenance payments for their children from their former wives . 
Feminism is concerned with gender difference, and its discourse aims at equal rights. In a general way, when it comes to the Western society, it is possible to say that feminists goals are gradually being achieved. It is soon to say if the consequences of the theoretical equality of genders is good or bad for the society, but the reactions that happened so far show that this is a controversial subject. Before the revolution, it was easy to define mens and women's responsibilities men were the hunters, gatherers and providers and women, as the care-givers, took care of the children, of the house and, of course, of the husband. Today there are fathers in charge of the housework and mothers providing the financial sources . 
It is important to consider that both women and men can benefit from taking on more than one single traditional social role, and that there is quite a bit of research to prove it they show that multiple roles can be beneficial. The researchers have found that employment was associated with health improvement for both single and married women who had positive attitudes towards their jobs. Likewise, men who held multiple roles also had better health researches have shown that multiple roles do improve physical and phychological health . 
However, a routine that includes work, home, children and husband doesn't seem to be that easy. The studies and theories about the subject don't really mention the quality and the results a life with multiple roles has. Children education is another controversial issue and the problem with it starts at home. If a child doesn't have available parents, bad consequences will come, sooner or later. And if you don't have enough time to dedicate to your job and to focus on your career because you are taking care of your children, how far will you be able to go professionally? If you work too much and, when you are not working you are taking care of your children, how will you be able to keep a good relationship with your husband? Then, you have a mutiple role life - but with what kind of results? After all, are you really equal to men? And the most important thing: By living the supposed equal life, will you have time to actually live?
