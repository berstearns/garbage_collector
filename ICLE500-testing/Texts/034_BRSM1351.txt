Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Since the word was first used in English to describe the mobilization for women's suffrage in Europe and the U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and even before that, when the term was still not in use, feminism has been one of the most controversial topics for discussion in modern society. It attracts, both the sheer passion of those who advocate for it and the repulse of those who are against it. But most people speak of it without fully understanding what feminism is and what are the implications it has had upon women's lives. Men and women, who deny the importance of feminism, and, at times, even consider it to have done more harm to the cause of women than good, say that what the political movement has mainly brought to women is not more freedom of choice or better opportunities in the workplace, but rather, it has taken women away from the house, not giving them any choice of staying in and taking care of their families without being undermined by modern thinking. Furthermore, feminism has deprived women from their most important characteristics and has been turning them into the men they never wanted to be . 
Those who advocate the feminist thinking, on the other hand, believe that feminism, as a social and political movement, has been the most successful, and even only one to achieve its goals in the 20th century. Feminism, indeed, has proved itself as a powerful opinion former, and its ideals have been gaining space in mainstream culture every day. Women and men who have never even studied the feminist agenda are, and have been, passing forward its ideological thinking, having understood that both genders are equal and can take part in the same social, economical and political activities, as opposed to the understanding of the past generations, which considers women and men to have different roles that should be respected and not surpassed . 
In conclusion, there certainly is always going to be discussions as to whether feminism has brought any kind of improvement in women's lives and made them freer and more complete as human beings, but, the fact is that, being able to discuss such matters and to defy the roles that were once set for women and men is, itself, an evidence that women, and men, have benefited from the struggle that feminists have put since their beginning as upper-class Suffragettes until their present as police officers, carpenters, doctors, executives, academics and even Presidents .
