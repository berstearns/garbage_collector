Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is the way we use to buy a lot of things today, like food and drink, but also plesure, entretaning and good moments in travels arround the world. It was made just for it, to be the highway to change things that we have in other things that we want. Without it we would need to transport cows to a change point and get some corn. The question is, with the power that a lot of money bring in our capitalist world, could we simply have anything if we had enough money? 
First of all, the kinds of things that we can buy are not just simple things that we need or substantial things to change our lives. These things we are talking about are mostly a representation of status nowadays. We can define it as eccentricity or any other word, but it is something that, in its most, looks like a selfish, meaningless way to show oneself. In addition, we can directly relate eccentricity with fame too. So, the famous and rich start a movement to spend their fortune in nonsense actions . 
Some says that eccentricity is related with geniality too. For exemple, Edith Sitwell, the British poet and daughter of the eccentric Sir George Sitwell, 4th Baronet, of Renishaw Hall, wrote: "Eccentricity is not, as some would believe, a form of madness. It is often a kind of innocent pride, and the man of genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd." For sure, Edith Sitmell has her point, if you consider that Albert Einstein was used to picking up discarded cigarette butts off the street in order to circumvent his doctor's ban on buying tobacco for his pipe, piloting his sailboat on windless days, but nowadays, eccentricity became a instrument to rich and famous just strive for attention. In particular, we can describe rock bands like Nirvana and Guns and Roses, known for destroying most of their instruments or their own hotel rooms just for fun . 
On the other hand, not everything is lost. We still have many people that use their money in a good way, such as Paul David Hewson, Mr. Bono Vox, known for his cause and philosophy to help people around the world. Just like him, we have others, like Madonna, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, celebrities that do not use it to travel to the moon and call for pizza. They conscious of their status and use this on their side . 
In conclusion, we cannot say that the way money and status are used today is only a matter of point of view and justify any act, or that money can buy anything, but we can see that the values of some are not on the right direction. If the capitalist system is not fair with everyone, we do not need someone burning their money in something stupid or selfish. We need more people worried about important causes and about others .
