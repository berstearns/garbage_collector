Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
The time when a university degree could guarantee one a better job is long gone. In today's world, not only has it become ordinary to all of those who are seeking a position in the market, it does not prepare those who do find one to the kind of work they are going to perform. As a degree became a prerequisite to enter the job market, universities all over the world started creating courses to all fields, including those that did not necessarily require a 4-year curriculum . 
To start with, the syllabi of the universities courses are rather theoretical. Therefore, students who dedicate years of their lives being prepared for the career ahead of them find themselves ill-equipped when facing the world outside campus. Coping with the new reality is often a better preparation for the work itself than having all the knowledge involved in a particular area, but no practical experience. No sooner does one leave university than they realize that. Furthermore, much of the content learned in universities is irrelevant, while the process of learning it nurtures a plethora of attitudes and behaviors which are directly contrasting to what appears to be needed in real life . 
On the other hand, there are many courses that are vital for one to perform their job properly. Careers such as medicine and advocacy have constantly been developed in order to adapt to new practices in their areas. These courses really prepare their students for their work, as all the theoretical knowledge passed to them during their years of study is an essential element in their careers. What is more, the acquaintance of theories and the familiarity with the foundations of the field contribute to the improvement of area itself, as these new highly-educated professionals will become the architects of the courses curriculum tomorrow . 
Taking everything into consideration, one can say that university degrees are overrated. If they do not prepare their students to the job market, why are they so prized? Managers and directors in all areas give more credit to a university degree than to a highly-experienced professional, but little do they consider that the latter has more tools to efficiently perform his tasks. While universities do not start considering these matters, their students will continue to learn about work at work, and about life by living it, as Charles Handy, an educator with many years experience in business and public services, once said. And he adds: We could do more to make sure that the process of education had more in common with the processes of living and working as they are today, so that the shock of reality is less cruel .
