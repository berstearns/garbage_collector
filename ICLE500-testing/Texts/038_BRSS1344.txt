Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Like is writing on the Bible, in the New Testament, and people says because of thousand years of common sense, money is the root of all evil. But, if we start to thinking about that, even the Catholic people, the phrase does not make sense . 
How fair is it to resume all evil on gold, silver, salt, coins, or any other medium of exchange? Money is just one way of get things. The problem begins in man's desire for power and status. Probably, if they rethink about that phrase, it will be the root of most evil is the man's vanity. One should never expect the Bible to be consistent, and sure enough, it isn't when it comes to evil. One of the very first acts of evil committed in the Bible has nothing to do with money. In the Book of Genesis, Cain kills his brother Abel because he is jealous that Abels offering to God was better received than his own. He is jealous that Abel has achieved higher status or power than him . 
While the Catholic Church created this common sense around the money, the Protestants interpretation of Bible, and the human History, is money is the solution for all evil. This thought was and still is the base on all development of industrialized countries that did not punish who have worked to join money, or have had ambitions of growth social and financial since the old time . 
And today, are the developed nations maintain this thinking without any trouble? No. Idealists wonder why we can't live in a world where everyone is equal, and therefore where there is no greed or jealousy resulting from status differences. Unfortunately, they overlook the fact that our desire to have higher status than others is part of our human nature, and nothing can change it . 
Greed for money may be a good thing when people play by the rules, and when their desire for money and status results in better ways of doing their business or in inventions that help people and that make the world a better place. Desire for money and status is only bad when people do bad things in order to obtain what they desire, without think in the other people. And even then, it's not greed that's really bad, but the person who's doing the bad things who's bad . 
The goal of communism was that an economic system would be created where no one would be rich or poor, where everyone would have equal wealth. The problem is that such a system is impossible. Mans desire to rise ahead of others is too strong, and money is not the only thing that man competes over. And because all men are not equal in ability and other characteristics, no matter what the playing field is, some will rise ahead and others will fall behind, and those who are behind will feel intense jealousy, even if the competition is about something other than money. The goal of a just government should not be to punish people for being successful in obtaining money, but to create rules to ensure that competition for money results in good for society . 
On the contrary like the old song says, Money is the root of all evil / Won't contaminate myself with it / Take it away, take it away, take it away, take this though away, and do what is right, to you, to your neighbor and to humanity as a whole .
