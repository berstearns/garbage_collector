Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
One of the most popular main of communication nowadays is television. There is one in each house in the occident and now it has been arrived in the orient too. Children grow up seeing its programming and it is forming character of many, surpassing until the education obtained in school. This occurs because of many factors and maybe there are no more possibilities to revert this situation . 
Marx once said that religion was the opium of masses, but today it is no longer truth, because a greater opium has risen in our society, the television. He couldn't imagine so strong instrument of control in his time; he has only determined the manner how this control functions, but it can be applied not only to religion but to all kind of control and television is the most relevant and common instrument nowadays. It's that what well talk about in this text . 
Parents use television like a babysitter. They goes to work and lead their children to school and after that, the children stay home alone with nothing to do beyond to watch television. Or parents stay home with them, but they are not interested in having any activity with theirs suns, so the TV is the easier way to solve the problem. All the programs in any part of the day are very interesting, attracting attention of the children but have no profundity neither are important or educative. The children passes all day watching TV, they learn that to read is a boring duty and become victims of the system of control . 
Today there are many adults that have grown up in this kind of TV education. They are problematic, presenting problems in communication and socialization; they don't like their jobs and many of them are unhappy. Besides, they are absolutely abstracted and don't have interest in politics, economy or culture. They are only guided by the mass, following and believing exactly in what they see in television the new music of the moment, the new season of their favorite TV series, the manipulated and limited news of the newscast. They are zombies of the system, exactly like they are meant to be . 
Matrix is a movie trilogy that represents well this alienation of reality. All the human beings are controlled by a computer program that makes they think they are exactly what they want to be. They are used by the system like batteries to make the world of machines functions. It is a representation of control that really exists in our society, but in a more veiled way but so harmful as the example . 
By the way, there are very important questions that have been done and in which answers we have to think about: Who makes television to do what it does? Why can anyone want a thing like that? In the real matrix, we-batteries are used to make what functions? If anyone could know the answers for that, he certainly would be out of the manipulated mass and would become a manipulator too .
