Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Nowadays, we live in a world where people are totally dependent on modern facilities. These facilities have began to be introduced in our society from industrialization which allowed a great improvement on the life of people . 
This progress brought with it a great change in economy, politic, science and society in general, but mainly in culture. People became fascinated to the progress of technology and then, so many inventions like telephone, computer, microwave, etc, transformed the life of people. All these changes came to improving the living conditions of population but they caused an acceleration of time. Nowadays, everything is so much faster and the velocity of information makes people have rapid access to facts which are happening around the world. Add to that the globalization is also a result of this all transformation . 
There are no doubts that inventions allowed a great development of the society but what did happen to feelings? What did happen to dreams? What did happen to imagination? Well, people are so much worried to acquire more and more material products, they are working in an uncontrolled way to get so much money to buy too expensive houses, last generation cars, last generation cell phones, high power computers, notebooks, etc, and the scientists works to make the best technologic discovery of the century. Anyway, people are living to get things, material things, but they are forgetting to live a real life . 
So, I think it is a wrong way to live. In my opinion, they are loosing the essence of life because all efforts are concentrated to technologic searches and natural values are in a second level. But, where are dreams and imagination? They are also concentrated to build an artificial world. It is obvious that there are exceptions but now population is thinking in an individual way. They are destroying nature in name of progress and scientists don't mind with the consequences of scientific researches . 
In the university, there are some courses that are considered theoretical and because of that they have less importance than the technological courses. It is a portrait of being thought. The courses that prepare students to think or the courses that claim imagination not application or courses don't prepare people for the real life, these courses do not have the same relevance than the others because the world needs the great technological discoveries and not only people that are thinking about the matters of society . 
One day, I read in the internet that the human imagination is what will allow us to control science and technology for human needs and I agreed with that, because nowadays we are more needs than dreams. Everything what we want, we easily get, everything is on our hand. By the way, science and technology exist to provide these needs and then, dreams are easily achieved. Because of that the life looses sense. So, it is also necessary to cultivate our soul. I think it is necessary to give more importance to relationships, nature and human beings. It is necessary to use our imagination to make something good to our animals, ours plants, our planet and human beings. It is a dream that can be get through science, technology and also imagination . 
Anyway, we are living in a modern and industrialized world and it is impossible ignore science, technology and industrialization because they are part of our lives. We must use them to supply our human needs but we must use our imagination and dreams to feed our souls .
