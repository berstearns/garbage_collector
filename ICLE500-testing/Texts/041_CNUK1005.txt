Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
As a university student, when I entered the university and chose my major, I found a phenomenon that some subjects offered are theoretical, which caused the students' complaints. They think the theoretical courses are not only boring and difficult to learn but also less practical. The present would needs people with practical skills and knowledge to solve the problem in their work. Moreover, when they apply for a job, they stuck in a dilemma situation: they possess the diploma or a degree requested, but they haven't experience or lack adequate practical ability .
We are now entering a brand new era, a completely new stage in its history. The new century is a time of advanced scientific and technological knowledge. As the rapid development of science and technology, there are rapid changes in all aspects of our life, even the value concept. Today is a era quite different from the time when those writers, poets and artists were highly respected. They most desired and hot professions are president of big company, CEO, manager, engineers, doctors, and so on .
So when the students choose their major, their parents also approve them to choose some hot majors, so that they can easily find a decent job, make a comfortable life or even make a fortune .
However, there are also some people agree that superficially some theoretical courses have no practical value, but without the theoretical knowledge, one cannot develop overall. But we should know everyone has limited time and energy, therefore it is impossible and unwise to emphasize too much on some theoretical subjects. We have to face the reality, we should remember a worthy saying: "the survival of the fittest." The heavy pressure from the job market forces us to put our limited time and energy into practical courses. If we don't adopt ourselves to the development of our society, we will be eliminated in the fierce competition .
When we were children, our parents often told that if you don't study hard you will be a unuseful person. So they toiled everything to support our life and education. They send us to the school and hope us can get good education and will find a good job in the future. That's their plain dream, but what we will see? A student study three or four years in the university, after graduating he find that it really hard to find a decent job, and the knowledge he acquired in the university is not as useful as they expected. In contrary we may find some people without high degree but they have high practical ability and skills, they really like a duck in the water when they apply for a job. Education aims to arm people with more knowledge so that adds to their competitioners in their future career and enables them to live better. If the education is the university don't follow the development of our society and the courses offered are too theoretical but less practical, we dare say the education just decorate our life but give us nothing .
Things are always changing, with the passage of time, some major are not to be in great demand. We your generation should keep pace with the latest advance of science and technology. Here I'd like to mention another thing - teaching material. Not long ago a friend of mine talked about his university life, he said, in his first class in the university the professor told the students that the subject was not only boring (because it was a theoretical course) but also what they would study was the research result of fifty years ago. He felt very angry and asked the professor a question " Why should we learn this subject, we come here is to learn the up-to-date knowledge, not such useful rubbish. When I heard this, I felt very sorry. The school administrators have to know what is in need in the labor maket and then decide which courses they should offered to the students. I still remember a passage which said " We'd not educate children only for the purpose of educating them; our purpose is to fit them for life." That 's really true .
When I talked here, I think of our education system. It has to improve. Education is key to strength of a country. In long-term, the school cultivate the young generation not only enable them live better but also cultivate more talents for our country. It is the high time to pay more attention to this issue and do something for it .
