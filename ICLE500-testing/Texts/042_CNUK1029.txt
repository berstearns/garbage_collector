Title: Should military service be compulsory in your country or should the army of your country consist of only professional soldiers? Discuss.
 
China is a nation which has the traditions of unity and strivation. According to the law, every chinese citizen has the duty and responsibility to serve for the army when the nation is in danger of being threatened by other nations, in danger of losing the sovereign and territorial integrity. For us, military service should be compulsory .
When you look through chinese history books or when you call on at chinese history museums or martyr monuments, you will get to know many chinese citizens who lived in the tumultuary age were willing to join the military service in order that they could drive the intruders out .
Maybe you will remember the father of the nation, Mr Sun Yu-Xian. In his time, the government of the Qing Dynasty was a puppet. It was under the control of other contries. As many other patriots, he joined the military service and managed to overturn the governance Qing Dynastywith great efforts accompanied by other fellows. Eventually the Democracy government came into being under the guidance of him. It made a good foundation for the complete liberty of China .
Also, chairman Mao Ze Dong, one of the founders of the People's Republic of China. In his age, the situation in China was worse than before. Several countries such as Britain, France, Japan etc had been longing to split China into pieces or to under their fully control. At that time, he followed the call of the country and served for the army without hesitation. He and other revolutionary people tried ways to relief China out of bad situations. Finally they succeedeed in having resisted the invading forces and having put down the domestic war and having founded the new China .
If we don't have the principle of impulsory military force how comes the achievements today .
Nowadays, the world structure has greatly changed. Though we live in a peaceful age, cold war is still existent. We don't know when another war will begin. Also recently, the news about terrorist attacks can constantly strike on us. We should be courteous .
In order to defend on ourselves, we need the army which consists of only professional soldiers. They are the main force on this matter. Only can they know how to operate the equipments well. Only can they be good at the strategy in that crucial time. But from the combat capacity point of view, owning the professional soldiers is not enough. We also need up-to-date weapons and equipements to improve the quality of the army as a whole. They can reflect the comprehensive national force and economic power of the country. They are also connected with the GDP and scientechnological level. Take the U.S.A. as an example .
Both the economic power and comprehensive national force of the country are on the top of the world. These advantages will contribute to the combat capacity of himself. It is possible for him to spend large funds and high-technology on manufacturing up-to-date weapons and equipments. It is possible for him to train the professional soldiers to become more capable and more competent. It could be fully manifested from the Iraq War .
For Chinese army, it is the same. It needs strong combat capacity and it also need more competent professional soldiers, which will contribute to our construction .
Since the reform and opening up, great changes have taken place in China. The economic power and comprehensive national force are better and better. We need a peaceful environment in the course of modernization. We should have the army which consists of only professional soldiers to keep the safety of the country. At the same time, we, every chinese citizen should be ready to join the military service to keep fence for the revival of our great country .
