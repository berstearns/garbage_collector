Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
In my opinion, feminists definitely have done a little bit more harm to the women who are now living in a world filled with heavy workload and under severe atmosphere. Some of them even have no time to take special care of their children. Probably, some feminists for such compromise will defeat me. However, in the view of my point, the world is combined by two parts: the hard one and the soft one, the former is male, and the latter is female who has gentle but great power to create the beauty world .
Traditionally, especially in East, woman used to be categorized to the part that could do nothing but give a birth to a baby or weave something at home. They have quite low status in the society; some of them even cannot eat at a table with their husband. Accordingly, in order to get higher status, female have been battling for quite a long time to obtain the same status with male until today. Of course, female is equal to the man, and they should have same right as man has. Nevertheless, nowadays, feminist go too far from the "right", they worked as a man, drink as a man, and some of them even refused to have a baby. Actually, it will do harm to such crazy female .
Over the world, the basis of a steady society is family. Consisted via male, female and children, such a complete family is able to do favour for the society. Over wise, lots of feminists believe in that the family could do nothing but destroy a gifted woman. So they suggest woman go out to work day by night, abandon the right to have a baby, even wear as a man. That's not the equal right! Man play his role in this world, woman does as well. Female have hundreds of ways to express their ability, not only on hard working. In Japanese, most of woman, who hold bachelor or above degree, will not go out to work after having a baby; they draw all attention on the family and children. Children could be taken special care during their growing period. When they come back home, mama could give them a cup of hot chocolate instead of cold dinner; when they are ill, mama is able to stay with them instead of working in a company for a large project. Certainly, woman will be respected for their contribution .
Both male and female are playing a critical role today via various ways. Father teaches us how to know the realistic world, and mother teaches us how to love others. Either of them is so important when everybody grows up. Feminists would like us to ignore the gender, and each woman should have a hard and cold hart to conflict in this serious world. However, achievement is not only formal working, and real "right" indicates that we should have right time, right place, and right lift-style. We should root our dreams and life in a warmer solid. Feminists, please be gentle!
