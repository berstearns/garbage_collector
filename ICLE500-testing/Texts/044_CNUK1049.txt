Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
As the development of society all over the world, more and more people from developed and developing countries tend to go to universities and get various degrees. However, there is an opposite opinion that university degrees are theoretical and of little value .
Although universities degrees seem to be of little value in the real world, they are still very important for most people. In general, the effect of university degrees can be divided into two main parts .
In fact, university is an important place to teach people basic knowledge in the academic fields, meanwhile, it is not easy to pass all the courses and get university degrees at last. There are five processes that you can take control of in your strategy for getting a good degree, which are: wanting to learn, needing to learning, learning by doing, feedback and making sense of what you are learning. First of all, from hard study people can learn to capitalize on teaching-learning situations smartly by making the most of lectures, small-group tutorials, seminars, studio work, field work, laboratory work and group work, which will be used as basic skills to be in charge of how to treat with work in real world in future. Furthermore, a lot of essays, reports, peer assessment, self-assessment, research projects, presentations and work placements may make people intelligent to contribute to the overall quality and classification of their degree. So the situation in the real world is. One more thing, in society, more people seem to be suffering from stress. Being a student has its own stresses as well. However, while at university many students can manage their stress levels as possible as they can by many scientific methods, which are analysing the causes, making lists to save somebody cluttering their mind, and trying counselling. It is definite that it will be made use of the real world. In addition, people can gain more basic skills used in the real world through attending to university programmes because of doing plenty of extra work that can stimulate their specific experiences, such as doing some investigations in depth. For example, people can develop their interpersonal skills that are highly valued by employers while at university. The reason is that university as a small society reflects the real one. What's more important. As we know, most university degrees could be seen as main factors to apply for their jobs. This is a reason for the recent condition that more and more people go to study at university. It is also a realistic thing in the modern society that high university degrees symbolise as high techniques in some specific fields. It can be said that university degrees can be seen as a strong competitive strength to compete in future .
However, universities degrees have a few problems. The most significant one is that people may not have a chance to get a lot of experiences for their specific fields .
According to the above discussion, it can be easily found that university degrees have both advantages and disadvantages. It can be believed that a few disadvantages can be solved in the future, even if there are a few disadvantages .
