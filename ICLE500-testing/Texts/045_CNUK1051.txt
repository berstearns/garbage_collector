Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
In most countries, capital punishment is carried out in the murder and some other very serious crimes. However, in latest years, somebody argues that if it is the best and the most humanism way to punish such a crimes. In their views, when you use the capital punishment to punish the murderers, you just kill another people, no more meanings than that. If you keep the murderer alive and execute the life sentence, you can make him to work in the prison for the left of his life, through such a punishment, he or she can do something good to the society. In their opinion, this way is both good to the society and the criminal as well and there's a fact that some countries or some parts of a country have abandoned the capital punishment. So, they advocated that should not be carried out. Unfortunately, nothing could be more misleading than that. In my view, as long as the serious crimes exit in our society, capital punishment should not be abandoned. The following are several reasons to support my opinion .
First of all, Executing of capital punishment is fair to the victim. Somebody says that just kill the murderer is not humanism enough; I think it's totally wrong. They killed other people, if depriving their life does not punish them, is it fair to the victim? Of course not, the life is the basic human right, nobody can deprive it just at his or her pleasure .
Besides, Capital punishment helps to decrease the crime rate and achieve a more peaceful social surrounding. It is common sense that human being fear of death, if everybody could realize the consequence of the serious crimes, they will take it into a second thought, and a lot of horrible deed behaviors could be prevented. The reducing of the crime rate will result in more peaceful surrounding .
Furthermore, keeping the capital punishment could upgrade the public's moral standard. The aim of capital punishment I feel is not just kill people who killed another one, is not just an eye for an eye, the true meaning of it should be educate the people what is good and what is bad, it makes the sense that everybody's life is important and could not be invaded. By doing that, each one in our society will regard other's life as precious as his or her own, love other people then care for other people, this the reason why the public's moral standard could be enhanced .
The above-mentioned points can clearly show you why the punishment is still indispensable. It is fair to the victim and their relatives, it helps to make a peaceful society and it upgrade the people's moral standard. Although it is important, on the neutral basis, I do not advocate the abuse of the death sentence, if some power wants to use capital punishment to achieve their bad intention, it should be absolutely given up. As a conclusion, if we can use the capital punishment properly, it helps to make our society more peaceful and orderly .
