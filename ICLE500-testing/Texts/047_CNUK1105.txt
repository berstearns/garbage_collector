Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
Human life is valuable and unique to everyone. Now one can decide when a person dies. Murder is a kind of most serious crime ' commonly ' around us. Everyone should be protected by the law and those murder should receive their appropriate punishment. However, should we send the murders to death in all kinds of murder cases? Life is valuable, so is there any contradiction to what we said above?
Capital punishment is not really applied to many countries which is bounded by law. It is a punishment that sends the criminals by hanging, injecting poisonous materials into the body or by using electricity. No matter what way is used, it is also horrible to the criminal. Therefore, before we decide if we should carry out the capital punishment, we should know clearly about what are the reasons to do so. Also, are there any other alternatives to replace it?
Undoubtedly, the death penalty is really threatened to the public. It is a good signal to threaten people not to the serious crimes. However most cases of murder may not be a ' well planned ' crimes. The murder may commit the crime unconsciously. Most of the murders may kill a person when they were in a condition of uncontrolling. It could not be denied that the criminals really felt guilty because of their unconscious decision. Moreover, murder is a case that difficult to be investigated. It may not be rared to find a case that was really determinated wrongly. Therefore if we sent the criminal to death, we might do something wrong and which is no return! Although there might be some ways for the criminals to appeal, it's still difficult to convict the judge to believe since in fact the case was determinated before. Besides, those cases with really evidence to prove the criminal is not guilty .
People may argue that since the murders killed people. It is fair to punish them by the capital punishment. However, is ' life replaces life ' is meaningful? In fact, sending the criminals to life sentience has been destrive their life freedom. They have no right to do what they want, besides receive orders in the prison. Actually, if the murders were punished for their who life time in the prison, the public has been protected. There are some restrictions to apply to the life penality if the capital punishment is abandoned. The reason for this is to gurentee the safety of the public .
In short, I think all people's life are valuable and important. The people being killed are pity and depressing to their families. However, killing the murder is just the same cases of ' murder'. Life is also being destrived. Moreover, we should let people admit their faults and give them chance to change. Human life is unreplaceable, we should not carry out the capital punishment because of ' fairness' to those were killed .
