Title: Should military service be compulsory in your country or should the army of your country consist of only professional soldiers? Discuss. 
 
In china, the PLA was consisted of only professional soldiers. But in many other countries, military service is compulsory and every citizen will have to proform as a soldier for several years. especially young university students. And in my opinion. military service should be compulsory .
There are several reasons why I think so. First, China, as the largest country of East Asia, had the widest borderline. To keep the whole borderline safe is not an easy thing. It need a large military force to be on duty all the time. But the soldiers sent to a certain place may not be familiar with the environment. Even they are professional soldiers, they may probably meet some troubles. If military service was compulsory, the border line can then be guarded by soldiers selected from local people who were familiar with local environment. And they can certainly do the job better than soliers from other places . .
Second, nowadays' young man are lack of life experience. They often care little about others and lack of discipline. Some of them even had never had any hardship and always waste things. Although Chinese government forced every university student to have a month's military training, it had little effect. People can't be changed in only a month. Comparing to these young man. those who had joined the army and serviced as professional soldiers are much more disciplinal and energetic .
So just imagine that if all the youngsters will have to serve in the military for several years, will it still be so many problems about youngster? 
Third, although the world is peace now, it still has the possibility of breaking out a war. And after so many years of disarmament, china's present military forces may not be enough for a war. But if military service was compulsory, those people who bad had military training can form a great military force at any time. That means almost every citizen can be the part of resistance to the invasion. Such things had happened once during the Second World War, when the Japanese army invaded China. At that time, almost everyone: soldiers, guerrillas and even citizens fought against the Japanese invader. And everyone may know that we won the war and defeated Japanese invader successfully .
Forth, armies formed by professional soldiers often developed slowly. Because every soldier had the same training and this made them always thought and acted in the same way. For this "the army had few good commanders and new tactics. This will cause the army losing the ability of fighting. Now the PLA was starting a 
revolution, "trying to avoid such situation. In fact, I think the best and easiest solution is to let military service be compulsory .
Although letting military service be compulsory has so many advantages, it also has disadvantages comparing to forming the army consist of professional soldiers .
For example: more money is needed to train soldiers, and soldiers may not as good as professional ones. But after all, make military service be compulsory can do good to not only the army "but the education as well. That's why I choose it .
