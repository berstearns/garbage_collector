Should military service be compulsory in my country or should the army consist of only professional soldiers? It raises me deep thinking of the formidable military service image .
In my opinion, not only should the military service be compulsory but also the soldiers in the army of my country ought to be professional. Army is part of the main strength of our country, whose members, the soldiers are required to be the most honest defenders of our country and our people. Professional soldiers play a very important role in our country, by doing their utmost to resist the invasion and be ready to sacrifice for our motherland .
In my country, soldiers are all selected strictly from all over the country, and then get professional training which makes them into qualified professional soldiers. However, considering China's whole national conditions, it is not good enough just to have professional soldiers .
In the first place, China has such a large population than other countries' that it needs a great formidable army to protect the country and the people. There are a great number of teenagers who have not continue to study in school nor to find a job, roaming in big cities or the countryside. Maybe they will come up with crimes which do great harm to the society. They drop up their study maybe because their poor family or because they themselves do not want to obey the rules in life. To some extent, in spite of their misdeeds, such guys are not so bad for they have sturdy bodies, tough personalities, which indicate that they can be fit for professional soldiers. Therefore, compulsory military service can help the country avoid the lost of talent and have better control of the society, by gathering all the possible strength to form a firm army system .
What's more, compulsory military service will do good to the education system. Once the policy that military service should be compulsory is carried out, the situation will be different. If a guy reaches the age of serving in the army, he must make a choice that whether to go on study or to have a job or just to join the army as the rules require as long as his body condition is qualified. In that case, the rebel guys are forced to make decisions to be a soldier or a student or a worker. In this way, guys need not be a member of the military service unless they continue their study or work. They will stay at school and have to learn. Education system is to influenced by the compulsory military service. Instead of roaming in the society, the guys will find their real direction of life. Thus, it is obvious to see the good that compulsory military service does to the education system .
The last but not the least, compulsory military service does not only mean guys should join the army at proper age, but also requires professional soldiers in the army. Professional soldiers should have good health first, and must acquire sufficient knowledge, keeping the pace with the fast changing world. Nowadays, the army system is much advanced with hi-tech equipment which provide soldiers excellent training environment. For example, the guys of our hometown who got professional training in the army are no doubt taken pride in by the people. They return home as both professional soldiers for our country and for themselves in life. The smart minds and tough personalities which are further developed in the army enable them to bravely face and cope with the difficulties they meet in life. They hold quite optimistic attitudes to life. In the long run, compulsory military service can play an important role in developing a person's personality into more optimistic and tougher form .
In a word, it is obvious that compulsory military service of my country should be compulsory and the army should consist of professional soldiers, for that will well improve the army system and benefit the society security control and the education system, even help develop the quality of people's mind .
