Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
For many years, capital punishment has been discussed whether it should be abolished. My answer is certainly "No". Murderers are cruel. And they are usually referred to the violent thugs. They should be sentenced to death. What they put them do put them beyond the pale of humanity. They are not humans and, therefore, they cannot expect to be treated as human beings. They must be made to see the error of their ways, and the only way of doing that is the capital punishment .
Murderers whose motive is money should not get off lightly. The professional killer who would not think twice about using his cosh or crowbar to attack and batter some harmless lady to death in order to rob her meager life-savings. It is absolutely wrong to think professional killer are insane and need hospital treatment, The only thing that is the most suitable to treat him is to punish him the same as the pitying old lady was suffered. Maybe it is too cruel, but it is quite necessary. Criminals must be made to see the consequences of their crimes . "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" is the very basis of justice .
Capital punishment used to be a major deterrent. It made the violent robber think twice before pulling the trigger. It gave the cold-blooded poisoner something to ponder about while he was shaking up or serving his arsenic cocktail. It protected the most vulnerable members of society, young children, from sex-maniacs. It is horrifying to think that the criminal can literally get away with murder. Therefore, we cannot abolish this punishment, 
Of course some people claim that it is ruthless to punish the murderers by the cosh or hanging. But had the thugs had thought that it was too heartless to the innocent people before they committed the evils. It is not the proper thing they need to worry about. Executing by shooting, hanging or injecting the poison are more humane than the other penalties at present imposed. Thanks to the modem methods the capital punishment is quick and painless. It is only the agitators who campaign against the death penalty who say it is cruel. The reality is that it is a kindness to the murderers. Far better to be shot or hanged than to suffer the slow torture of life imprisonment which is in any case a burden on the long-suffering tax payer.. it is also inevitable that some people are always willing to hold liberal views at the expense of others. It is always fashionable to pose as the defender of the under-dog. So long as you, personally, remain unaffected .
We all know that "life sentence" does not mean what it says. It is only a nominal sentence. It leaves a chance for the criminal to escape. After ten years or so of "good conduct" the most desperate villain is free to return to society where he will live very comfortably, on the proceeds of his crime, or he will go on committing offences until he is caught again. In no time at all, the murderer will be released. How can ordinary people feel safe knowing that there are murderers on the prowl and probably seeking their next victim? 
Only the capital punishment can ensure that people can sleep safely in their beds. So, there should never be suspension of capital punishment .
