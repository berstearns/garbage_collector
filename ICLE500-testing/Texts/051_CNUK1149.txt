Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
Capital punishment is the harshest form of punishment enforced in the world today. Whoever violates the law should be sentenced, by either serving himself in prison or being given a death penalty. Consequently, it's quite clear that criminals who had committed murder should face the executions for their evil deeds .
However, death penalty strikes some people as too cruel, and it is believed that it shouldn't always be carried out to deprive the murder of his life so easily. Therefore, capital punishment becomes a difficult issue in discussion and there are many different opinions about it, especially in America, where human rights are highly respected and capital punishment has already been abolished in some states .
Anyway, it is always true that everything in the world cannot be defined exactly as right or wrong, so we should be objective toward an issue, and look at it all-roundly. And it is the same with the view that whether capital punishment should be carried out in all cases in murder .
Generally speaking, capital punishment should be carried out in most of the cases in murder. First of all, it's obvious that punishments are made to punish those criminals and to prevent crimes, and would positively give a potential pause in the thought process of the murderer, using fear as an incentive for preventing recurrence. The harshest punishment for murder will set up an alarm for those potential criminals. If only they value their lives, they would not commit murder so carelessly .
Besides, once a person is proved guilty of murder, he should be sentenced to death, because justice must be served. Only placing murderers in prison isn't a tough enough punishment, since in jail they would have a possible chance for parole. But they actually did kill someone, and they should pay for it life for life. What's more, for the sake of the security of the whole society, we have to be some kind of inhuman or cruel to sentence those murderers to death, so that justice is served by executing them. They deserve it. They have caused much grievance to the family and friends of the victim, and execution seems like the only way that justice can be served. And only in this way, would the punishment fit the crime and would the victims' family and society get some comfort from the grievance and recover from the resentment .
However, things are not so absolute. When we return to the "nature" of the crime committed, there are some cases in which the murder has some reason to be excused. For example, he might be arguing with someone when he suddenly flied to rage, and beat that person to death without control. Actually, he didn't intend to do so, but in such a circumstance, he was out of ration; after the tragedy happened, he had regretted to death .
Similarly, there are many other possible cases that people killed someone by accident. They are not guilt in nature, but made some terrible mistakes - against their will. They don not seem to be that detestable to be executed just because of their offence through negligence. Some punishment in jail is enough to them, since he has already been condemned by the society, suffered great pain in his heart, and served himself in prison as punishment. He was taught to know that one should control his temper however bad the situation is. Provide the family of the victim and the society consent to forgiving the murderer, he can be given the chance of being good again .
Overall, capital punishment is an effective approach to punish murderers and prevent crimes furthermore. It should be carried out to protect the security of the society, and to hold the justice firmly, but there can be some exceptions. When the case of murder is special and when the murderer is pitied and forgiven by the society, the justice and the jury can make their decision by taking into consideration the circumstances, and try to avoid using the capital punishment .
