Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
As you know, thousands of people would lose their lives everyday for lots of different reasons. Some are die of disease, some are die of the old age. Some are die from traffic accident, some are murdered, and so on .
However, we can avoid so many person lose their lives. Reasons of disease, accident and age that are can't control but we can stop the murder cases raising. We can protect the right of life. We can also forbidden the unfair matters happen by rules .
Even though, in the society, there are still so many reasons that make someone to kill a person. Take money for example, someone will lose himself, will lose the humanity, just in order to get more money. They just think about themselves, they just want to enjoy the life without any effort, they just want to get but giving. In a word, they are selfish. They are harmful to every member of society. Once they are arrested, they will be capital punished. That's no doubt. And no one will feel pity about that. People even will say that, " That's the result they ask for."
Besides the money, under the seduction of the power, murder becomes more and more common between two different governments or two organizations. In some foreign countries, many political leaders were murdered, just because their political opinions go against their own. Here, we can't tell which side is right or which side is wrong, but we are sure that, " To kill a person or more just in order to build a new peace government, just in order to bring the fortune to people, all of these is not humane. It is even an excuse to clear the way for his own benefit. This case is also unacceptable. What's worst, this kind of case usually is abused by the whole world .
However, there is another kind of murder, which still needs discussion for the punishment. Why does it need discussion though it is illegal? Here, I will show the background to you. A cadre oppress the people with his power, and get much extra money from the people, who make the people live under a terrible sutuation. The people do nothing to him though they hate him very much. As days past by, this ill-treat makes people feel terrible. Finally, someone can't stand for him any longer and kill him. Well, he did a good job for people. And he would be praised by the people. But, from another point of view, he breaks the role, his behavior is illegal, he should be punished by the judge. In fact, the dead man is really not a good cadre, but maybe is a good husband or a good father. As his death, his families may go crazy, and couldn't live on normally. In another word, the murderer also did harm to people. Why do the people will agree to kill the cadre? Why do they will surport the murderer? That's because these people don't know much about the rules, and they don't know how to use the rules to protect themselves until they can't turn back .
According to this example, we can see that no matter for what reason, once you break the rule, you must be punished. If not, this world will become disorder, the life will be at danger all the time, the whole human being will stop developing. At least, human being will die out from the world. From that case, we also found a serous problem, that is, " so many people are lack of knowledge about rules." I think, that's the reason why so many people break the rules .
So, in order to keep the world peace, we must learn the rule and we must use the rule to protect ourselves. Besides, we insist that we will go on to punish the murder strictly no matter for what reason they kill a person .
