Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Why do people want to go to universities? Some people might say university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Well, in my point of view, people who said that might not be educated in university in their life. I admit that preparation for entering the real world is not enough for students in universities. But think about that, why those people with university degrees are easier to get a job? Doing degrees in university has both advantages and disadvantages .
The advantage of doing a degree in university is obvious. Why those companies want graduator of university? Because those people already have been educated in a high standard although in a very theoretical way. But theoretical does not necessary mean useless, instead, it is the experience of those people learned before, which can help university students preventing making the same mistake. Theoretical knowledge is totally not a bad thing. Let us compare to what happens in the real life, think about our driving lessons. I believe that pupils read awful a lot about how to drive before putting their hands on the steering wheel. Just like university degrees, they must pass the paper work like theory test then take a road test. People said that students get too much theoretical knowledge than practise. I do not think it is the weakness part of university education. Studying theory knowledge is the best way to prepare the coming challenge in the real life. The preparation to entering the real world is not just study theory test as well. As we are all university students, we know there is huge amount of research or business enterprise and all sorts of activity in the university campus. Within university you can meet lot of different people as well, just like the real world, people are coming from all over the country or even from different nations. What a chance to study different things! In the real world, we probably do not have those sorts of chance. So in my point of view, I think university is the best place to do preparation to entering the real world .
Of course, doing theory studying without doing practise is useless. In some university, it does happen which means when students enter into the society, it might cost them more time than others to be fit where they will be .
Anyway, I am a university student right now. I benefit from being a university student a lot and will be in my whole life .
