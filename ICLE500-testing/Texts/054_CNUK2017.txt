Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
Nowadays whether the capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder is a controversial issue. Some people believe that the murderer should be seriously punished by the capital punishment, while others hold the opposite opinion. As for me, I vote for the latter .
There are numerous reasons to support my point of view and I would like to list some of them as follows:
One of the first primary reasons is that the murders can be turned into useful persons if they were sentenced lightly. There is no denying that they have a harmful effect on the society and public, however, I do think everyone is kind and decent when he or she was born. Maybe sometimes they are forced to do that, therefore, they should be given the opportunities to correct what they have done. If they are killed by the capital punishment, it is true that they will not gain any chances. That reminds me of a TV programme which was shown a few months ago in my own country. There was a youth who had robbed and killed a taxi driver after drinking. At first, he should be sentenced by the capital punishment two years later. After entering the prison, he did not lose the confidence of his life. On the contrary, he tried his best to correct himself and did very well in all of the things. Maybe you cannot imagine, he even learned the courses relating to accounting by himself and got the diploma in the final examination. Due to his efforts, he has been lightened for his crime. Now although he is still in the prison, he has continued to do his best as well as his studies. From this example, we can easily see it is not necessary to sentence all the murders into a capital punishment .
The other main reason is that everyone has the right of living. So I do not think the murders must pay for what they had done with their lives. I maintain that the murders can be taught and trained by the appropriate approach. They may be changed and after they enter into the society, they can devote themselves doing many things that are beneficial .
However, as everything has its light and dark sides, we must admit that some murders who had extremely impact to the society and public should be carried out by the capital punishment. For example, they had been given some opportunities once. So I claim that the judge should distinguish the details and then make a suitable sentence .
From what I have mentioned above, I think that capital punishment should not be carried in all cases for murder .
