Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
With the development of economics and technology, people are more focusing on their own rights, power and freedom. In this modern society, women are becoming more and more important than before in many areas. They gradually have the equal status with men. While some people thought it was feminism and feminists had done more harm to the cause of women than good. It is unfair opinion. I am strongly against this kind of ridiculous thought. I support women could have enough freedom and the same right as men. I will illustrate four reasons to strengthen my idea .
The first point which is also a basic one is that women had a sad story of the past. As it is known to all that women's status was much lower than men's. They had no chance to be educated, go out like men and no freedom. They were thought they were weak and prejudiced. It is seemed that men control them and they were just like their husbands' slaves. Men thought the reason why women lived is that they need to bore children for men's families, especially in old China. It was a common phenomenon that women stayed at home to take care of their children and the whole family. They lost themselves. They had no freedom and any right in daily life and communication. So women who lived in the past were poor and symphsized. They had huge disaster which should have the same rights as men. Time is changing, the female should have chances to be treated and recognized as the same as the male .
Secondly feminists show the equal relationship between females and male. They do not harm to the cause of women but good. It is not wrong for women to own their freedom and power, there are some advantages displayed. Firstly feminism reflects that women have waken up. It helps women be more confident. They will notice actually they can do what they want to do and even something they never considered before they could do both housework and jobs as well. Women will be respected as well by good achievements what they received .
In addition, many careers need women such as teachers, nursery, caring and sellings. Women are careful and patient. They do better than men. Thirdly, feminists brought the great challenges to males. Male feel engineering and law. This kind of pressure helps men work harder than before. They thought they were men so that they should be better than female otherwise they will feel uncomfortable and lose face .
