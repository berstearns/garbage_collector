Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
Suppose you are shopping in a supermarket, when you have chosen a lot of things and gone to pay in the cashier, will you feel fair and comfortable if the staff tells you that no matter what you buy, you have to pay at the same price? Can you imagine you have to pay $100 for only a cheese cake? Similarly, if all kinds of murders are punished in the same way - capital punishment. It will be a kind of misuse of punishment and the laws will lose its real meaning - to protect every body's right and freedom justicely. There are various kinds of murders in the world, such as serial murdering, slaughtering, bringing other people to death, etc. Accordingly, we should set down the relevant laws to punish a guy who breaks in the same extreme way. If so, it will be a tragedy for a civilized society, and also for the equalization of laws .
Moreover, although some people hold it is as general truth that to punish these bad guys heavily can largely reduce the crimes by giving a signal to those potential criminals, things are going to the reverse. On one hand, the "real" killer will try to escape and even kill more because he knows that it makes no difference for him to increase the number of victims to 2 or 20. The result is the same. On the other hand, people who kill someone by mistake dare not to confess his guilty in the police station. Because the judge will not listen to his explanation, but also focus on the fact - someone is killed. So capital punishment should be exercised. Hence, no one will admit his behaviors. All they want to do is to hide themselves in order not to be arrested by police. Consequently, the whole society will become a mass .
Furthermore, for any human society it is not a wise way to prevent crimes from happening by setting up cruel punishment methods. Crimes do not exist at the every beginning, but happen unwillingly in most of the cases. As a result, the legistrational institutions should try to strengthen the constiousness of laws in public. And the society should provide sufficient resolving methods to its people, to help them get out of difficult situations both financially and mentally. Thus, less crimes will happen and the whole society can be peaceful in a real meaning .
