Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
ln the modern century, many countries have the capital punishment in the
legal system which is 
contoversial in the world. lt is because the capital is a cruel sentence
and many people said that if should be carried out. Although many
countries abolish capital punishment, it still survives in some
countries. People would like to illustrate the capital punishment by
looking at justice and equality to victims, to prevent the voilent crimes,
an inhumanity punishment and a good threatment to murder. This essay will
be to explain and discuss the capital punishment applied in law and
utilize the US and China to do examples. People can look at about
execution in their society .
The capital punishment is more equality and fair to the victims who are
harmed or killed by murder. lf 
someone is killed by murder, the murder has not got a heavy punishment .
Many people think it is very unfair. Therefore, if someone supports
capital punishment, it is rational to the murder cases. For example,
China and US enfores the capital punishment in some murder cases. The aims
are to gain revenge to victims or their relations .
The capital punishment enforced in the law which can prevent the violent
or serious crimes to 
happen. lt is because the execution can be more efficiency to stop the
serious crimes such as murder, assault, drugs problem or terrorism.ln
addition, in the criminal psychological, the capital penalty appear in the
law which can help the crimes to stop or happen and it can threaten
criminals to decrease .
Although the capital punishment seems to be very reasonable in the legal
system, it is not true 
because the capital punishment is an inhumane penalty to the criminal. The
execution, in US, it is to kill someone with an instrument which injects
poison to death. ln China, if someone had a conviction a sentence, which
is the capital punishment, he is shot to death. The government sometimes
show this punishment in the news, which is terrible, savage and justice to
the criminal. ln addition, some execution cases is charged to make mistake
but the criminal is punished. Form this show, ls the capital punishment
really suitable for all of murder cases? ls it fair? All of sentences are
true or reasonible for them. Nobody can answer that .
Eventually, someone said the capital punishment is a good solution to
have a heavy punishment to 
some criminals who are imprisoned for life. Some countries' the head of
state can amnesty the death convict, and the death-warrants change the
life imprisonment, for examples, Hong Kong a. lt is very common although
there is the execution in the law. As a result of some criminals have not
got any freedom in their life, it is more cruel threatment. lf the
excution is used , it is maybe more suitable to the criminal .
ln conclusion, the capital punishment is an rootedness in some countries .
lt is very difficult to escape 
the execution, which is very useful in the law. The capital punishment can
be justice and equality to victims, prevent the voilent crimes , a
inhumane penalty and a suitable punishment to murder or criminal. ln the
future, if the victim or victim's relatives decide the capital punishment
be applied to the criminal, it is maybe better as result for the victim or
their relatives .
