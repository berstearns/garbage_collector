Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Feminists, belonging to the most arguable issues in nowadays, play a core
role of job - dividing and social status' forming. Those who support the
equality of male and female believe that feminists are good for women,
while others insist that what feminists have done to women is definitely
more harmful. The argument has been continued for several decades. Along
with the researches of the scientists, new evidences are revealed to give
the latter one stronger proves. Following are the details of this issue .
To begin with, feminists do have given female more chances to prove their
capabilities and creativities. In many working circumstances, women are
playing more important roles than men, or at least equal to men. However,
scientists claimed that there have been too much more working stresses
put on women resulting in the unharmonious between family members and
home violence. According to Jerry Z Muller (2003), nearly 30 percent
women are facing home violence or quarrels with family members result 
from too strong working pressure, which all come from the ideas of
feminists. Dr. Muller said that women are the most significant elements
of a specify family, whose hormone are secreted to keep everything they
may concern into a certain balance, to reduce potential quarrels. The
more attentions women pay to their job, the less they spend to their
family members. What the feminists done is already harmful to women in the
passed decades .
More over, another important difference between men and women is the
strength differences. Women's abilities of heavy work are less than
men's. This phenomenon results from the different amount of water
contained in blood of men and women, the latter contains more than about
15 percent as well as that of men, reducing the oxygen delivering
capability of female. So, it is not strange that men are more suitable to
carry heavy things. Hence, it is too arbitrary to carry out feminists
without concerning the differences between male and female, even though
men and women belong to the same species .
In addition, it is obviously that women are easier to feel tied than men .
It is proved by Mr. Muller that there are more red cells in men's blood
(about 20 percent higher) than that of women's. Since red cells' duty is
to supply the oxygen to the body cells, less red cell inducing women are
easy to get tire in general times. Appropriate concerns about the
different situations between men and women are good to improve the
efficiency of the latter's .
To sum up, though men and women are both human being, they are still quite
different from each other, not only as individuals, but also as two
different genders, which lead to the unlikely job adaptations and family
maintenances. What feminists did in the passed several decades is
definitely too arbitrary to reduce the inappropriate situations that the 
majority of female were facing. Although everything has both sides, the
pros and corns, which is just like a coin gets two sides, each one-sided
view is not justified enough, what feminists have done to female is still
more harmful in the course of women than good .
