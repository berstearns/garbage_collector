Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Admittedly, universities and colleges are academic institutions, and they
are designed to teach students theories mostly. We can not get work
experience from university. Theories that we learn in university are not
enough for us to succeed in our future life. However, it does not mean that
university degrees are valueless; on the contrary, they are extremely
essential, because they indicate that we have learned things we have to
know and our personal quality has reached a much higher standard .
As is known to all, theories we learn in university are core knoeledges
that our forefathers summed up from experience. They are priceless and of
great value, and we must obtain. It will be easier task to keep theories in
memory first then practise in the social world .
As far as I am concern, What matters most we get from university is that we
know how to learn, which is vital for us to succeed in the future. There are
so many things we have to learn on our own while climbing career
ladder. Therefore, I think it is quite necessary we enter the university and
get a degree .
Many students begin to live an independent life after entering the 
university. We can not live with our parents, with our sisters and brothers
lifelong. We have to come out, live independently and live our own
life-That is what life is. Universities provides us a chance to live
independently. While we are preparing to get a university degree, we are
learning beng independent. In this aspect, we may say university degrees are
of high value .
After entering into the university, students get along with 
teachers, classmates and roomates; we also begin to make new friends. Each of
us is a social unit; it is our duty to get on well with others-this is a
life skill. Students become more polite, more considerate and more patient
after one year or two years' life in university. we have got that everyone
is a unit and everyone has his\her own idea. We should repect them. It is
obvious that university is a good place to learn this social skill .
Studying in university, we always see differences we never seen before. We
broaden our mind and vision here, and become knoeledgeable and sapient
gradually. We have got our own ideas; we can identify what is right what is
wrong. we know what we should do and what we shuld not .
perhaps university degrees do not value themselves very much; but beyond
degrees, we can really get a lot of things of great value. Therefore, I do
not agree the idea given at the beginning of my essay. University degrees
are extremely important and we ought to work hard to gain the entry into
university, and also take every effort to perform better in university .
