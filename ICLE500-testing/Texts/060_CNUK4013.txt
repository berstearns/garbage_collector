Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
This essay will discuss that whether all the cases of murder need to be
published as capital punishment or not. In my opinion, not all of the
cases of murder need to be capital punished. I will give you two cases to
show you why I think so. One is unter the heavy stress, people murder,
the other one is under emergency situation. Nowadays, the law prescribes
murderer need to be taken the capital punishment. Sometimes, murderer
needs to be understood why they kill the man. Some reasons I think people
ought to understand. If you were her or him, what you could do? So, in
the court, judger ought to know the situation, make decision what to do is
right or not. For example, I saw a message in the newspaper, it said, a
man lived with his three children, a daughter and two sons, and his wife .
This man liked drink, usually being a drunker, and he had a bad temper .
After drinking, he always beat his children, the women in order to protect
her children, always be beat, the neighbour always headed the noise came
from their home. However, the women had stood for a long time. One day,
after drunk, he came home, but he wanted to rape his daughter, his wife
saw that, she could not bear it, with the long times torture, she killed
his husband. In this case, judger need to consider her situation, under
this stress, what she needed to do, and she killed a bad man, no benefit
for the society, but had harm for the children and women, so in this case,
the women ought to free, she totally do not need to be punished by the
capital punishment. Another case is if the people under the emergency,
they killed the people, but after that, they ask the policeman actively,
so I think in that situation, people do not be punished by capital
punishment. If two people fight with each other, one people did not very
care about the other one, he or she did not mean to kill the other side,
after that, he or she asked the policemen voluntary, then told the
policemen what had happened, and he or she was not mean to kill other
people, only fight to each other. Under this situation, I think judger
need to consider this problem in another view. At least, the murderer
does not need to be punished by the capital punishment. Only putting he
or she into the prision for many years is enough, do not need to have his
or her life, let him or her alive, and make him or her does more
contribution to the community. To sum up, this essay discussed whether
murderer need to be capital punished or not. In the two cases, the
murderer did not need to be punished by the capital punishment. One is
under the heavy stress, and other one is under the emergency, they did not
to be punished by the capital punishment .
