Title: All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service 

In this rational world where almost everybody seems to think rationally especially about things concerning money 1 have sudendly found that people act highly irrationally if they have non-professional army. Every professional army draws a big sum of money from national gross product. And what about non-professionai armies? If they have every single year new men. And they are not trained and prepared to work with military hardware as the professional soldiers. They can easily cause a great damage or misfortune . 1 know several cases when a soldier injured or even killed his colleague because he did not know how to operate his gun properly. What a luck we do not have nuclear weapons. Military service lasts for one year now . 1 think that in such a short time period soidiers are not able to acquire habits how to do their job correctly . 1 think if they were professionais they would not need as much money as they do now .
But the question of money is also closely connected with the time that the young men have to spend in their military service. All of them have just finished theîr studies, their training for their future jobs which they want to do ali their lifes. They have been trained, they have been prepared, they are ready and they have to fullfill their honourable duty - to lost at least one year in some nonsense institution that is calied army. lf you are for example cîvil engineer you will spend the year listenning to some orders instead of projecting new buildings, bridges, etc. After this year you will forget a great part of your université knowledge. If you wants to run your own business and you a great idea, you almost have the money you need and it is the right time for you to start you have to put it off till next year and it is usually late. And the same goes for any other occupations - teachers, carpenters, doctors, artists, bricklayers .
And the worst problem with military service have the young marrîages with children. Some of them got married during their studies at université. They do not usually have their own fiat and their have to live together with their mothers and fathers-in-law. Terrible. They do not have enough money because he or she or both of them have just graduated. They cannot find a job. Their child is often ill. Mother usually stays at home with the kid at least for a year or two. And in such a situation father has to do his military service. Of course, he can ask for deferment. He can get a deferment for a couple of years. And the government promises that in such cases father will be placed near the family, not further than 20 kilomètres away from their hometowns. But ib 1 know a family where the husband is more than 200 kilomètres far from home. Their military service lasts only for five months. What can they learn in such a short period? The officers often know it and so the soldîers just spend 5 months killing their time by reading books or lying on the beds and doing nothing. What is the reason of taking away the head of family? The only person that is able to earn some money. Well, the family gets a smala amount of money from government but it is only minimum of living standart .
So I say: "Let"s stop the military service. And what more. Let's dismiss the army at all."
