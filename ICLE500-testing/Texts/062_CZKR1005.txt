Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The human imagination has been till now the most perfect and unbeaten computer of the world. After all brainwashing by computer games, video, TV and mass advertising it can't be replaced by any computer or robot .
Really? Is it really still true? I remember a sci-fi story which I've read several years ago. A lonely woman, operator, by chance got acqainted with a man by phone. Their phone-calls became more frequent and the woman thought that she had finally fond someone, she would like to stay with, someone who understands her and accepts her. What was strange was that the man always avoided meeting her and he didn't even want what he looked like. The curiousity and the desire to see her beloved made the woman search for his phone number. What a shock it was to find out that her friend was a computer!
The present science and technology have accomplished so incredible things that we could even hardly dream about several years ago. Scientists experiment with so delacate materials as the genetic information and brain cells are. Don't they fear that once they'll reach the top, they'll have created a perfect robot which will be not just a perfect copy of human body but also a copy of human feellings and ideas?
Some people say that in our modern warld there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But on the other hand there is exactly the same number of people who thing just the opposite. They realize very well the danger which goes along with the technical progress. They try to draw our attention to it and fight against it with their own means .
Arts have always been a way of a balance and resistance to modern world. Artists have been expressing their opinions towards science and technology. Apart from a few euforic periods when they glorified them they usually warn against them. Take Jules Verne as an example. How many of his utopic visions have come true! Certainly many sci-fi writers could have become the prophets of modern era .
Remember how many poets wrote ethusiastic poems about technical civilizations. And what conclusions did they arrived at in the end of their work? They usually glorified the nature and natural life of people far away from the technical world .
Why are present people becoming more and more interested in ancient myths, philosophy and religoin of the Orient? Perhaps it's the archetypal need of man to whom modern science failed to answer the most crucial question of human existence, the need return to the very beginnings when the white was white and the black was black .
Look at the present film production. What makes a commercial film successfull? The story which is put into an interesting setting somewhere in the Universe, exotic country, ancient history or unexisted world of fairy-tales, shortly in the environment which we can hardly know and which incites our imagination, But this presentation and imposition of some topics could be risky because the choice of topics for dreaming is limited. If kids are attacked by dinosaurus, turtles and Barbies from all directions their imagination is preset. The children aren't able to choose the right for them. Their parents should protect them from pressure. I know that it isn't easy to persuade children with quite a high level of technical education that the magic carpet and wand existe. But they also long for romantic stories. If some classic film fairy-tele appears in cinemas it's always a box-office draw .
You needn't be a fanatic freudian to understand that human creativity and taste have their roots in the early childhood or what you learn in the childhood accompan you for whole your life .
But there is another problem. Can arts protect themselves from the influence of science and technology? We know that already exist computer programmes which are able to write books and draw pictures themselves. Could happen that the most important element in arts - the man - will be useless?
Now let me quote several words from I-t'ing: "We can't loose what really belongs to us even if we threw it away."
We have strive to protect the most important assets we have - our mind. Once it could be stollen to us .
