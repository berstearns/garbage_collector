Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
"Feminists have helped women to be free and independent but they have made them unhappy". This has been repeated in American media for last several years. Such hints have appeared in Czech press too, though feminist movement has not influenced our society much yet. Susan Faludi writes about this phenomenon in her book "Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women". She says that many women do not want to call themselves feminists, though they think women's movement is still neccessary. Faludi claims it is not feminists but the continuous campaign of the White House, press and Hollywood against feminism, who are to be blamed for women's unhapiness. Who is right the, Faludi or media?
Nothing in life is so simple. The answer is much complicated and the causes of the problem lie deep in our minds. People of the end of the 20th century are used to systematic thinking. The flow of information is overwhelming and we are afraid of the complexity of the world. That's why we need to put everything in a group: works of arts, , people, their opinions, ideas. Everything has to be classified, everything has to be clear. If you say something that is considered a feminist idea, then you are proclaimed a feminist. If you say something against feminists, you are proclaimed sexist. Never mind what your doings are; what other people think you are - that is what matters most. This systematizing the world brings people relief; they believe they have beaten the complicated and hardly understandable world. But the result is not so pleasing: we do not understand one another .
Why don't we understand one another even when we use the same words? We speak in categories and classes when we discuss a problem. But everybody has a slightly different idea of the same category or class and eventually we do not speak about the problem but about what we mean by our words .
We can use a metaphor to describe this incident: we buy wine according to the label on the bottle (without being able to tell the difference), and also we do not discuss the quality of wine but the brand of it .
As far as feminism is concerned, the result of such attitude is blaming feminists for women's unhapiness. What is actually feminism. It came into being in 19th century when women were totally dependent on men, could not vote and work. Suffragettes are also classified as feminists (this women's movement at the turn of the century became famous for its agressivity), as well as other movements in the 30s or 60s, some of them very radical. S. Faludi says that during the feminist revolution in the 70s feminism was understood as an effort to bring women the same rights that men have always used. Carola Biedermannova; a Czech feminist answers the same question this way: "Feminism is making women's economic, political and social rights work in real life." Those definitions are the same as one definition in Webster's dictionary: "organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests." But definition 2 says that feminism is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes .
Well, what do we mean when we say someone is a feminist? Does that mean that he or she fights for women's rights or that he or she only believes in the equality of the sexes? We cannot blame a group of people for something when we don't even know who belongs to this group .
No, it is not feminist's fault that some women are unhappy. It is obvious that women needed their movement because they were not socially free. Now they are or at least they can e. If they are unhappy, it is neither feminists' nor anti-feminists fault. The reason is in them and in all of us who cannot get rid of the old view of woman. Our attitude towards woman does not accord her new position in society. But this is not a political problem, it is a problem of human culture, a problem of bad communication .
We should strive for making our communication work again. It is no use to contemplate whether someone fits to a certain category, either feminist or sexist. We should rather try to listen to what he tells us and how we can help him. Then we will understand one another .
