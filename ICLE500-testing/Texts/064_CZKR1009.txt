Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money - for one a big trouble for another a possibility to buy almost everything. Since it has been established money became a need for all people .
Money is a reward for our work, money can be a theme of a novel or a film, sometimes money is also a scale of somebody's success or station and unfortunately money can be a reason of a crime. You can hate it you can also condemn it but you must have it because you need it. Where is the mistake? In money, man, in human society, in economy or in government? I do not know and I also do not now any solution because I can not imagine a society without money yet - it was only a communistic Utopia. Money is still needed to assess results of human work but I think that society should lead each person to arrange his or her own scale where not money but morale is in the first place, where human life has the greatest value, where love and human honour can not be bought for money .
Money is important in our contemporary society but it is not the most important thing. Who says that money is not weighty he or she is a dreamer. Without money you unfortunately can not buy meals, clothes, books, car, house, flowers or a small thing which makes you pleasant. I thing that money can make one independent. You need not live in a stereotype, you need not be worried about your job, salary, accounts and debts. You can take holiday everywhere, you have much more opportunities how to spend your leisure time. But you can not buy love, health, friends or feelings .
Who affirms that money is the most important thing he or she is an agnistic person without possibility to feel something or believe in something or somebody, he or she became a slave of money and he or she would de everything to have it. People like this exist all over the world. They can kill because of money, they can steal and rob, they sell drubs to young people, they organise prostitution, they do business with arms and weapons, they blackmail others, there is a coruption in this world - this is that evil because of money; Why does it exist? I do not know why but I mean that the evil is not money - this is only reason - the evil is in people .
But I believe that people can overcome it. They have to improve relationships among them, they should regard each other, they should not avoid feelings, they should educated their children in love and in morale and in respect of our life and life of other people, they should teach their children to find the real beauty in small, common, everyday things. They should believe in something. People should not measure a person according to his or her money, they should find inside them because not that one who has the most money must be the best but the one with the great personality .
