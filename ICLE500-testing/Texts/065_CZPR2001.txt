Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
I will try to prove this statement by giving an example of the law of Domestic Violance, which is often regarded to be a great success of the feminist movement. During my visit to the U. S. this fall, I had a chance to experience an interesting situation concerning the law of Domestic Violance. I will tell you a story, which didn't happen to me. I heard it from a person, whom it happened and I know this person rather well. The law of Domestic Violance (understand in California because I think that each state has a slightly different one) may be a good way to get rid of an uncomfortable husband. All of this happened about 2-3 months ago. A wife together with her boyfriend, a former wrestling champion, arranged a plan how to fire her husband from their common residence. As several times before, the wife provoked her husband by cutting by a pair of scissors his credit cards, which arrived in the afternoon mail. To defend her I have to add that these credit cards were common for both of the wife and the husband and that she didn't want to be a part of them. They had several quarrels about it before. So, the husband started to yell at her just in time when her boyfriend was approaching the door with a not too well acted friendly smile . "How are you, guys, doing ? I was just passing, so I thought ...", he tried to explane. But soon he changed his tone of voice because the wife told him : "Nick, he hit me and held me under my neck !", she pretended. Her boyfriend, twenty years older than she is, but still in a good shape after many years of his wrestling career, started to tremble with anger . "You, get out of here or I'll kill you. I used to kill people for four bucks during the war in Vietnam, you know ! ", he threatened. He was getting more and more nervous. So, the husband didn't hesitate a minute. He left the house immediately without saying a single word. He didn't want to get hurt or provoke that silly old man. After he left, they called the police together and reported that the husband hit the face of his wife and held her neck. The restraining order has been signed by the judge that the husband can't get closer than 100 feet distance to his own house. What a terrible surprise it was for the husband, when he returned home the next day. The door lock was changed and nobody was at home. So he went to his wife's boyfriend's house to get the keys. He thought that his son might have been playing there. He didn't know about the restraining order. His idea was to take some things from his home and move to his friend's house before things come to order again. But what happened was really a painfull shock. His 12 year old son, manipulated by his mother and "uncle Nick" shut the door in front of his father's face and called the police. The restraining order was valid for the boyfriend's house also. The disappointed husband and father was lucky to escape. He couldn't believe what had happened to him. He remembered the days he spent with his son. There weren't many because he worked hard 7 days a week. He remembered how he was buying his new house, all the things he bought to equip it ... What happened to him doesn't happen twice in life. Now there was no possibility for him to return home. There was really no save area in the whole situation. This story seems unbelievable but the worst thing about it is that it happened " in accordance with the law ". Practically, he couldn't appeal against the judges decision. He didn't have any witnesses, while Nick would say or do anything to gain the wife's liking. He could have hired a lawyer to represent him in a case but with all the charges etc. He decided to let things go by their natural way. Such a case would cost him a lot of money. Actually, with the law as it is, he didn't have a chance to succeed, anyway .
