Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. It would be interesting to have Marx in late 20th century. Maybe, he wouldn't replace religion with television. Maybe, he would say that the religion, hand in hand, with television is the opium of the masses. Television and religion don't compete each with other, they cooperate to form the ideal conforming, consuming, religious T. V. addict. One can watch T. V. during one Sunday morning and can find all the things he or she needs: T. V. preachers keep telling you what to believe in, what is a sin (don't forget that also not paying taxes is a sin!), what is good and evil, what will happen after your death . .. Then we have a short commercial break and they let us know what to buy, they let us know that life is funny and easy when you know how to spend your money. Don't worry if you have no friends to talk to: you can talk about T. V. programmes on hot lines advertized during commercial breaks. Commercials are propably the biggest evil because one can hardly avoid watching them, especially, when they are in the middle of the movie. It is also difficult to turn on the T. V., when the chosen programme starts, just in time to see the titles and at time to avoid commercials. Besides their omnipresency, the second danger is their artificial presentation of reality. At the beginning we usually see desperate person deeply in troubles but, fortunatelly, there is a product able to solve his or her troubles and brighten his or her world, which is after using this particular product suddenly full of nice, often young, but always successful, smiling people. Who cares about reality ? Definitely not producers. How does it effect the thinking of people who are not able to see the borders between T. V. fiction and real life ? Are children clever enough to realize that that nice, artificial world is not a reality ? Taking this into consideration commercials focused on children are the worst kind of blackmailing. Parents are those, who are able to earn and therefore spend money, but children are exploited to squeeze their parents' money. Everybody should be able to decide what he wants to spend money on and when a child doesn't know the value of money, it doesn't mean that it can be used for increasing one's profit. Fortunately, there are not only commercials on T. V., but also programmes with some educational impacts and valuable films, theatre perfomances and it is also the source of news (hardly an independent source, but still quite accessible). Key to the using a television as a source of valuable entertainment and of education lays in a creating of certain public taste. In some cases religion can also sometimes help someone when becaming the source of comprehensive approaches towards eternal questions, but we should keep in mind what reality is and we still should keep aloof - not to be addicted on these two opiums, because every addict is a slave of his drug .
