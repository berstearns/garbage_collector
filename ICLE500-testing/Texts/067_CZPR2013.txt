Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is the root of the evil Does it mean that the evil was born when money became the medium of payment ? No. The evil was there - in people. Money just gave much more possibilities to grew up human vices such as jealousy, greediness, and envy. Money came and society began to differ. People began to make money and to differ from each other. They began to distinguish as for how heavy money - bag they had. Money - market was born. It gave the possibility for such a inborn feature as a rivality is. Money makers began to look for whichever - good or bad - way of geeting money. Everything had to get its money form and such a relative value was getting to be the only value that people accepted. Everything, every work, everyone is touched by money, is valued by money that became the most important value one meets on the way to the real thing, the work and the human being. Of course, people want to compare, to have knowledge of facts so that they do this through their money form of value. But they often forget that it is just a relative value given today, tomorrow it is different. It is not possible to rely on it. Fortunately, a lot of people consider money form as the only value. It causes blindness - stupidity and simplicity. It is comfortable to live for money. People like money, want money and are dependent on it. One cannot have a bread without money. People are dependent on society they live in. Milo≈° Forman said that money gives him freedom. Does it mean freedom in the society ? I think so. One needs money to be free in ones society, to enjoy ones life. One can eat whatever, buy whatever, travel wherever, see whichever performance or movie one wants. Simply - to be happy and free. While people short of money have to check and divide their money among many things they need, want and they would like. So that they have to realize prices, compare them and count and count. To be in a dictatorship of money. When people loose their freedom as for money, it is really the evil thing. Secondly, it becomes the sense of life. It is very simple and stupid. It is dangerous too. People who in a hunt for money are loosing them are near to loosing their lives. But the evil is in people, money just caused confussion in us, in values we have, in society we live in .
