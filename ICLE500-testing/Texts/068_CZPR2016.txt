Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
Out of non-representative sample of all pupils from basic schools one third - the same amount of boys and girls - wanted to study university. I am speaking about CSSR according to research of 1989. Parents of all children that have been observed considered practical reasons to have influenced them . ' Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. Does it follow that the one third of these children was interested in practical aspects of university adducation and either didn't know about or mind it's not preparing for the ' real world ' ? Sounds strange. So something is wrong? Had parents known about their children's fault and warned them university had neither practical value nor it was preparation for the ' real world ' ? How to explain that only 30% of pupils with excellent school achievements and low-adducated parents are going to study school preparing for university and 60% specialized schoools ? With children doing as well in school and having one parent with university degree at least, the proportion is right opossite. After the first research was over 57% of observed children was accepted to study secondary schools. That makes approach to university possible . 38% of scholars claimed they would attempt to study for university degree. Have parents known about little value of university degrees ? Or didn't they want to ' close the door ' before their children mature and decide themselves wether to study or not ? Did they ask only secondary adducation for their children ? Or weren't they interested in ' real world ' of their children and desired only practical advantage they hoped degree was giving ? ' They are therefore of a very little value . ' Are they of a value ? Don't they - university degrees - rather constitute values ? ' They are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world . ' But they prepare \ theoretical \ attitudes. These change the real world. Thes even change the world that is not real now : these prepare the world for future generation - people without any attitudes, not knowing what is to be attituted to. According to responses of children from working - class families, one quarter of them thought the best way to ' life success ' is to be workful - have frinds - be conflictless. To be workful - adducated and specialized was being chosen as the right way to ' life success ' by children of highly qualified specialists . 60% of pupils haven ' t chosen being skilfull in something as the right way to life success : 40% refused adducation as way to life success. Only one fifth have chosen both. Of these children who expressed the highest adducational aspirations, one third didn ' t consider adducation important for life success. One half of children with this aspiration did not consider being skilful in something more than the others important for life success. How to explain it? They expect university will not prepare them for practical life? Is it the reason why they have chosen to study for degree ? And what happened than was the missunderstanding between these two generations ? Most parents thought their child's decission to study university to have been chosen for practical aspects? Or isn ' t the question wether to study for degree influenced by thinking about ways to life success at all ? Do children think about life success ? Is there any selfevaluation required? Teachers recommend 80% of children of higly adducated parents and 30% of children of unqolified workers to study on secondary schools. Doesn't the idea of the way to life success - even when there is no adducation or qualification required - cancel the decission to study for degree ?
