Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
. If he was alive at the end of 20th century, he would replace religion with television. As I do not like Karl Marx, I must say he was right in some cases and some parts of his ideology. For example his theory of socialism was very different from its later version presented and provided by Lenin or Stalin and their followers in many countries. I do not want to say that I would like to live in Marx's socialism. However it could be good and progressive in the middle of l9th century, today it is old - fashioned and step back. But strightly towards the main topic - television. Even when there are some similarities between the influence of the religion (by my oppinion more correctly the " church " as an institution) and television I do not think both things are something like opium. Surely, it can be used to manipulate with people as we could see on the examples of so called brainwashing sects last time in Switzerland and Canada in October l994 (as for religion) or on the example of state - controlled and censored televisions in totalitarian countries (as for television). But there are also many differences between religion and television. In the past, churches (of any religion) were very strong, centralized, effective organizations, systems that couyld achieve nearly everything they wanted to. What about television now ? Each television (TV station) is also very well organized system, but there are hundreds or thousands of such and all together they make an unbelievable mixture with nearly no common purpose or target (except earning money). And spectators can choose. I should say some of them are sometimes frustrated from their opportunity of choices. They do not know what to choose. There is noone to tell them what to choose or how to choose. Someone tries to catch everything and another one becomes to be depended on television. But not all. It is not problem of the masses. There are also a lot of people who are TV abstainers. The main problem of television I see in its influence on children and youth. There is no doubt that television works sometimes as opium. Some children are able to watch TV all the day. There are of course many educational programms and TV helps to improve knowledge, but on the other hand also damages imagination of children, their own activity, independent thinking and shows the world in the different way than it really is . (i. e. increasing number of programms showing violence or cruel scenes . ). Many children then do not know, they can not distinguish between reality and fiction, they think everything shown in TV is normal and it belongs to life . (To kill a man on the street just because he had coat colour I did not like, it is normal. TV heroes do that, don't they Mom ? ). Children watch television for many reasons: it is very funny, it entertains sometimes it isw adventurous and mainly it is very easy. Just push the button and sit or lay or what else. Many parents do not have enough time for their children and they often say: " Oh, be quiet, be good, go and watch TV. " Then television becomes to be the only thing that educates the child (if it is young, later of course thereis also school - but as I can say from my short practise - two years - of teaching at elementray school, during the school breaks children very often talk mainly about what was on Tv yesterday, what is today or which new film they have on video . ). Is there any chance to stop the evolution of Homo televisionis growing from younger and youger generations ? We know about some, some new things will have to be prepared and thought. We will have to pay more attention to the personal contact with the child during the process of education. More attention and cooperation from parents, teachers and other adults. We can not educate children just through TV screen or other machines. New methods of education should be invented, more involving programms for youth (I do not mean TV programms), another types of entertainment. And entertainment is the main thing that children demand. I am not sure we can solve the problem with ways we use today. It is similar to teh problem with opium or other drugs. Legalize it ? Abolish ? Reduce ? Fight against it ? No, something completely, completely new. There is a time for new Einstein or for new J. A. Comenius. Prague 22th November l994
