Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
It has been so long since people used to read poetry as an entertainment, since they used to go to the opera instead of going to the cinema as it happens today, it has been so long since people knew the names of the writers, painters and composers of their time, both the famous and the condemned. Nowadays there are computers, videos, CD players, cameras etc., nowadays there is a new and modern world here. We all know the great differences between the life at presence and the life let us say hundred years ago. We know that the time has been changing and that it has been changing fast. We have the things we could not have before but on the other hand we don't have things we could have before. We no longer travel by carriages and I don't think we ever will and we don't invite our friends for the evenings of poetry reading. That all means the time is different but does it also mean that the man is different as well? It's true that the man is different but still he is the human with his desires and expectations, with his griefs and pains. He is still the man full of dreams and imagination. Some people say there is no place for dreaming and imagination in our contemporary world but their arguments are rather weak. They usually say that we are enslaved by the mass culture and omnipresent modernization or (it's another frequent point of view) that imagination and mainly dreaming belong to the age of romanticism and it is, after all, gone. It means that only a few romantic souls could be still dreaming in this time and that imagination (according to what people think) is for the artists who we can simply call fools. But this is a wrong idea. We have to realize that there are specific things in this world which can be hardly destroyed by any technology, science or even politics. Imagination and dreaming are such specific things. If you are once born with it nothing can change it. So the problem is not that there is no place for imagination or that there even are no imaginative people but that there is a very bad acceptance of imagination. I mean that many people create something in their minds but often there is no way for them to realize it. I speak mainly about those cases where the imagination is concerned with fine art and literature. And why? Because for example poetry does not make any money. And so we should not say that there is no place for dreaming and imagination but that today it is no time for it. We don't need no place for dreams, no place for imagination, we all have one: our minds. But we do need to find some way to make our dreams come true. We know it was always difficult but maybe in our time it is difficult little more. Who cares about pictures, sculptures, music, poetry? Who goes to the theatre more often than to the cinema? Who cares about imagination?... It is too difficult to think about those strange things one's mind can create. It is too boring. Sometimes it is too old fashioned, sometimes it is too modern. After all we have much easier ways to entertain ourselves. It is so pleasant just to sit and watch TV where there is no end to fighting - we don't have to think so much. We are tired. We have to work because we have to make money. We need money and comfortable easy living. No imagination, there is no time for it. There is no audience .
