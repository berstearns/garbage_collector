Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
A definition of feminism stated in dictionaries is usually very simple and sounds very innocent: the principle that women should have the same rights and chances as men. This principle must be definitely considered as justified and rightful. Nevertheless not many people (especially not men) imagine exactly the above termed principle under the word "feminism". The bulk of the worldwide population would defined it rather as "some sort of furious activities practised by over-ambitious females". They imagine angry, rattled women marching through the streets, yelling "We do hate men!" the question is if such an opinion can be or should be contradicted and accused as wrong misleading or simplified .
All the main slogans proclaimed by feminism, i.e. radical feminism, because only this branch of the movement expresses itself aloud enough, those main slogans advise women not to get "enslaved" by marriage", not to become "factories for producing children", not to let men use them as toys to play with... Such ideas might be not only unpleasant for both men and reasonable women but they might be also extramely dangerous for the growing up generation .
Girls are as intelligent as boys but we cannot ignore the fact that the two sexes have different inborn qualities. It is a fact! Boys are rather rational, girls more emotional, boys are usually more ambitious or wilder than girls, who are very often placid and modest as far as their career is concerned. Everybody would agree that both girls and boys - or men and women, if you want - should have the same right and opportunity in employment and education but at the same time even the radical feminists must see that there is a certain number of girls who will be perfectly satisfied as housewives or taking only part-time jobs which will leave them enough time to look after their families, their husbands and children. And thereis no reason to blame the girls for following this traditional female role-model, no reason to call them "slaves" and to prevent them from their choice. Of course, not all young women will be satisfied with this social role. Despite of that they will be able to divide their interests between their professional and family life in most cases without any problem. There is something unnatural in the feminists'vision of a "househusband" or a highly career orientated woman .
Feminists advise not to have children. Why? Don't the feminists see what power it is hidden in the ability of giving birth to a child? Females are not "factories for producing children", their bodies are ingenious, strong as also many male gynecologists state, they are able of something very special and inimitable. Why should women get rid of such an honourable status?
Are women just men's toys? Another nonsense. Every real man, even the toughest one, becomes soft as wax when dealing with a charming, i.e. real woman. Men would never admit it and feminists don't want to see it but it is a lady who governs her cavalier'life. And her power is in concealing the fact and being aware of this fact at the same time .
Feminists and their generally known activities seem not to fight women's discrimination to win equality for women against men, more likely they strive to be like men. Women should stay women. The original idea of feminism is undoubtedly right but the reality is very different. If real women don't stop feminists from their interfering in time we could have to face a very weird war soon - women versus men!
