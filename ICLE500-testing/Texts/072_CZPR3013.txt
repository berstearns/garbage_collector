Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is an important part of our life. Human beeing stands on the existence of money. Everyone needs money to satisfy his own necessity. Money produces evil among all people in spite of proverb: "All is not gold that glitters." Same people have the only aim - to get money no matter how .
Money determines social position in society. High class is represented mostly by businessmen or employees of American firms. American firms offer to their employees high wages but they must submit everything to their job. Their families and children have nearly everything they want but they lose their fathers and their family life is missing. At that time children are influenced by their friends very much. So there is a dangerous of gambling, alcohol, drugs etc .
Gambling is important problem among young people. Gamblers need a lot of money to play games. They are dependent on the games in a while. They spend all their money and still need them. They are able to do everything to gain money for the games. Children often steal money at home. Dependance on gambling is something like dependance on drugs so gamblers are also treated in medical institutions .
Crime is connected mostly with money. Thefts, robberies, murders are realized especially because of money . "Appetite comes with eating" so crime is spread more and more because some people wants still more and more money. They are able to risk possibility to get in prison but their yearn for money is stronger. For example gangs, which are interested in stealing cars, have been increasing. We can ask why? The answer is that they have a large sum of money from this. It is unbelievable that someone can exchange a part of his life in prison for money. Even if they do not hesitate to use violence or murder anyone only for money .
Everyone is used to live in his living standart. Importance of having money we feel especially when we have not them enought. In this case we started to think up how money gets. People imagine that money can fulfill all their dreams. Actually it is truee but not at all. When you have a large amount of money you can buy everything, but you can not buy true friends, health, love of your wife, your husband or your children. By public opinion research in Czech republic, where people were asked to their value of life, we have known interesting things. In these years people's opinions have been changed. Importance of possessive has increased and overtook importance of education and hobbies. Result from this research is unpleasant not only for me. The people are not interested in education or hobbies but mostly in money. It never mind what a man does but the main thing is how much money he earns .
All people need money, it is natural. But important is how much they are able to sacrifice for money. Children suffer from their parents' work because they are all time in their job. Children having enough money can start with gambling. Then they need money more and more so they are able to commit a crime. People's oppinions have been changed in consequence of reaching money. Somebody has the only value which is money. Where a lot of money is, evil exists. Money and evil were and will exist. We must try to put it down .
