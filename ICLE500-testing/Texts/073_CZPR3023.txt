Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
What role does money play in human life? We can hear in words of one old song:" Money is the root of all evil". On the other hand a lot of people are persuaded that money assures happiness. I think it is not possible to characterize money in general. There are many points of view from which money can be looked on. I found three of them the most important : money as an essential part of life, money as a means how to make life happier and easier and money as temptation to the sin .
Money as a condition of human existence in today society has also the great influence on human freedom. The word " freedom" has different meaning than it had in the history. Man is free if he is not dependent on anybody. To be independent means to have enough money to be able to live. To live independently means to do whatever one wants to do and what is not against the law. Money assures that. If you have money you can buy whatever you want, you can travel wherever you want, you can realize your plans. To be financially independent means not to be afraid of what you will have for dinner tomorrow. The feeling of material security is the necessary condition for effective human activity. Everybody is aware of the value of money and does his best to have it enough. The quotation "He who says money has no sense for human life does not mean his money but money of the others" perfectly expresses human mentality. Money decides what place you take in the society. Money motivates people to work hard to have higher income .
Money has the power to make human life easier and more pleasant. It can even change life into paradise. This all depends on who treats the money. If people treat money in common sense it can help them to realize their dreams and to reach happiness. Everybody has different ideas on what happiness is. It can be a new car, travelling or a lot of pets. For somebody to feel happy means to help the others who need money more than the owner. By the human acts of donating money to the poor and sick people many human lives were saved .
Finally, negative human qualities can change money into the disaster. Money is the leading power of the world. People do anything to have money. Even though they can fairly work in classical way they prefer to earn money in various simplier ways - they steal, hazard with their and other's life even kill each other. Blind with the vision of wealth and better future they can not see the results of their acts - baffled fates of innocent people, baffled fates of themselves. Money works as a drug. If such a people feel how sweet it is to have money they want to have it all the time and they do everything for it. They steal and kill again and again. These people do not live normal life. They are victims of money. Not money is the root of all evil. The root of all evil is bad man with his negative qualities. Money serves as a means how to realise the evil. Money causes many disasters in family life. Because of money a perfect family can change into the pack of wolfs. Family tragedies are often caused by the question of inheritance. Children kill their parents, younger brother kills the older one, wife kills her husband. This all prove how strong position money has in human life. It has so big power that it can break the relations between the closest friends. Because of money the wars start. Because of money people do not live naturally. To gain money one has to learn to dissimilate, to trick, to lie. The lack of money causes human suffering even death. The example of this evil expresses the situation in the developing countries. Thousands of people die during one day because of famine which is caused by the poorness of the country .
Through ages mankind is characterized by the human qualities which were given to it by God. Positive qualities make the good and negative ones make the evil. Both together make the reality of life. This world has no chance to get rid of any of them. They are like energy - still constant only changing the forms. As I have mentioned money can not be characterized in general. The money in the hands of a wicked man causes the evil. An intelligent man, who knows what the real human values are, spends money in the positive way. So, money can not be characterized as a good or bad thing. It is just means by which we realize our life and fate .
