Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value .
We can deal with this topic from various points of view. The first point of view could be an analysis of the assumptions contained in the title of the essay The statement contains three questionable assumptions, namely that most university degrees are in fact theoretical that even if they are theoretical they do not prepare students for the real world and they are therefore of very little value. Let us have a look at these 3 points in turn .
- It is of course a big generalization to say that most university degrees are theoretical - that they are only theoretical and have no practical content. Such a statement ignores the vast body of vocational qualifications designed to train people for particular careers mainly in scientific engineering, medical fields. etc. Many such courses include periods of practical experience in industry, hospitals or other appropriate areas. The courses must of course contain theory as well. A doctor must know how the human body works in order to cure his patient. A civil engineer must understand laws of physics before he can design a bridge. Therefore students are given special lectures on appropriate disciplines concerning their fields of study but they also have to spend a certain time in practice where they are supposed to make themselves acquainted with their future profession. For ex. students of Medicine have to spend some time in hospitals where they are thought practical things - they are thought "how to treat a human body in practice". They are sent from one ward to another to be able to cure all the human diseases and later they can decide what they will want to deal with. They can choose their specialization .
- I do not know what is student teaching like in other countries but that is true that a period of student teaching is strictly limited in our country .
In my opinion students of the disciplines mentioned above should spend more time dealing with practical things .
- Many university degree courses are not of this kind however. Those concerned with arts subjects and some very theoretical sciences might be at first sight labelled "theoretical". Knowledge of medierval history or works of literature might be considered to be of no practical value. However in such courses of study students are essentially doing practical things - reading, researching, analysing, writing etc .
- This brings us cocnveniently to the second statement that such courses do not prepare students for the real world. It is arguable that if students are doing practical things even whilst studying subjects of a more academic nature they are acquiring skills and developing their power of intellect and understanding. These skills can indeed be of value in many walks of life not least business and public service especially when the information technology explosion of the 20 th century bombards us all with increasing data, information, statistics etc. In this case our theoretical degree could be of help for our comprehension of such demanding scientific and business fields. The students who has followed a so-called "theoretical" course of study can be well equipped to deal with this .
- This conclusion brings us to the last of the three assumptions, in that "the theoretical course of study cannot be of any practical value". The theoretical course of study can indeed be of practical value as it is mentioned above. However to confine ourselves to a definition of "practical value" means to condemn ourselves to a utilitarian view of life. Study of arts, history, literature, music etc. adds to the richness beauty and fulfilment of life and must surely provide value. These aspects are as much part of the real world as a routine of day to day living .
- Now let us look at the second point of view. It could be named "the role of university education in society". Society should have an understanding for a general role of university education. Such a type of education should be absolutely different from other types of higher education. Universities should help their students in developing their power of logical reasoning. A university graduate should be able to solve various problems but he should especially have a courage to admit that different problems exist in different types of society. He is supposed to be self-contained after his graduation of the last year of university. He is expected to be able to orientate in various kinds of literature and theory .
It is necessary to maintain an independence and sovereignity of universities. It would be regrettable if universities dealt just with disciplines and subjects that are convenient for practical purposes. It is possible to say that cooperation of universities and practical sphere is necessary and inevitable but an independence and sovereignity of universities must be saved at the same time .
