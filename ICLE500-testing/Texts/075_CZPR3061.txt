Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industralization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But I do not think so. The mankind civilization could not reach its now-a-days standard without dreaming and imagination. Our dreaming and imagination are being fulfilled every day. So we can fly by planes, sail by liners and submarines, we discovered new lands, we are still finding new worlds in the universe. We have large cities where millions of people live together .
Let's make retrospective outlook on our lives. When we were children, we dreamt about fairies, witches, princes, princesses, dragons and all these creatures from the fairy-tale world. We were imagining how it would be wonderful to be like they were, to live in their world. But time flew and we got older. We started to perceive the real world where no creature from the fairy-tale lived. I started to understand my life as a neverending row of problems. To live means to solve these problems less or more sucessfully .
And when hard moments of our lives come, we dream about easy childhood how careless it was. We try to imagine the world without problems. But it is not like this, so we must keep on trying to create it according to our dreams .
After finishing the school studies we meet problem how to find a good and well paid job. Everybody wants to feel that his work is needful and makes sense. Everybody, I hope, does not like to work just for himself, man wants to earn money to feed his wife and children. This is our dream to have a nice and happy family. We all remember the time when we first fell in love. When the first love came away and we felt so dissapointed the dream that we maybe would find new love and new meaning of life kept us " alive ".
I also dreamt about man who would be my partner for the rest of my life and who would be father of my children. As a child I wanted a prince, of course. Then I met several men, but my heart was beating as usually. Now I am married it means I found him. I can say I am happy. He is the same like in my dreams. He is clever, gentle, tall man with blue eyes and salt and pepper hair [ even if he is twenty five ]. We started to build our own world. He works in insurance and I hope that I start my teaching in this autumn, finally. We are on the very beginning of our lives we are talking about it every day, but not only about the way we want to live. We are also talking about those little important things such as f. e. the colour of furniture and carpet in our future bedroom, because now we live in a lodging .
We cannot get rid of our dreaming and imagination because it is just inside us and it helps us to live and makes our life more beautiful .
