Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
People certainly need something to believe in any time, but I would probably not compare religion to television in this way .
Some kind of religion was an important part of people's life from the very beginning of human existence. It went through a plenty of changes and it had a plenty of various rites, myths, legends and beliefs. But still in each of these variants religion was trying to answer people's questions about things like being, life, truth, death and so on; and it was trying to help the people to find the right way in solving their problems, it was giving them some certain hope of a better life, justice and retribution .
Television, on the contrary, gives none of these. Television is just a means for entertaining but nowadays it certainly is the opium of the masses. People spend hours and hours watching TV, usually they even do not care what is on the programm, but they still have to have their TV set on .
Even much worse, maybe, is the situation of the children. They have no other source of fun when their parents are at work. They come home from school and there is nobody to take care of them and to play with them. They are bored and the easiest thing to do is to watch TV. It souds like a horror that the children nowadays nearly do not read books at all .
Here appears, of course, the usual question the violence on TV and its influence on children. I think everybody would agree that there are some programms which children should not watch, like horrors, psychological horrors, films about disastres, erotical films and so on. These films are usually presented late at night, so this is not the main problem. The main problem is, that the violence has spread all over the TV programm, and in many cases we can find a lot of brutality and violence even in films for children. Some of these films, or even more cartoons, are simply based on presenting violence as a way of solving problems; and the children, who are not really able to distinguish strictly between fantasy and reality, absorb this message deeply and use violence in real life as the easiest way of getting out from a difficult situation .
Television, like religion, can show the people some models of social behaviour and ways of solving difficult situations, but the main difference is that religion, in each of its various forms, was trying to show the way which was considered as right and just in the society, it was showing the good examples to be followed, and every misbehaviour or crime was punished. Religion had a great influence on people, but it was an influence in a good sense .
I can not agree with Marx then, who said religion was the opium of the masses, because opium can never be good; but I agree that television is the opium like that, although it can never replace religion .
