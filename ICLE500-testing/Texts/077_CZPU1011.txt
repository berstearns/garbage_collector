Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Do feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good ? It is not easy to argue not. Women now complete half or more of the places in law and medical schools. The salary gap between men and women is disappearing fast. Women are gradually doing their way into the top ranks of business and public life. At
home, middle class fathers took cooperating with great enthusiasm. Public intolerance for violent, sexist behavior is widespread. Crimes against women are taken seriously and punished .
So what ' s to do next? A lot of .
The most stricking women ' s issue of today is the situation of single women and their children. Sixty per cent of them live below the poverty line. They have a big call on our social resources .
These women and children need several kinds of help. First, we have to make divorce to cost more for fathers and to cost less for mothers. Divorce usually lowers everyone's standard of living, but it hits mothers and children much harder. Fathers should be made to pay .
The current debate about who ought to pay taxes on child support money is a ' red herring'. The real issue is, that about 40 per cent of fathers pay irregularly or not at all. Many methods of enforcing compliance come to mind. Someone has to support the children : better the fathers than the taxpayers. And while we are at it, there is a need for a complete overhaul of the runious adversarial way in which custody and support issues are negotiated .
Second, single women have to be discouraged from having children. Several hundred thousand dollars on TV commercials tellin men, it is wrong to hit woman is being spent. One wishes it would spend the same amount telling young girls it is wrong to get pregnant. Children of never married mothers fare worse than children of divorce, because they stay poorer longer. It is time for feminists to admit that having a child without a husband is usually a recipe for poverty, and to acknowledge that a child's right for a decent standard of living is more important than a woman's right to choose how and when to be a mother. Issues of morality, double sexual standards and the responsibilities of men are all interesting, but out of point. The point is to help young women to avoid bad outcomes for themselves and their children .
Third, there is a need for more accountability from the whole array of women's services - especially shelters and rape crisis centres - to ensure that they are actually helping their clients, instead of fighting destructive civil wars over strange issues of race and class. All money spent on racism training should be immediately diverted to help people in need. The money spent on racism training alone would probably fund another two or three women's shelters .
Fourth, reward of employers who are trying to create family-friendly workplaces should be encouraged and publicised. Experiments with flextime, telecommuting and family leaves are more important for women than all the sexual-harassment policies have been ever written. A business needn't be rich to try these things. It must be creative and thoughtful.now the profits are on, family policies are creeping back into the radar screen .
Fifth, do they need more women in positions of power and influance? The more there are, the more certain it is that women's and family issues will be aired. That is why women still need fund raising to make sure more women are elected to public office. That is why women should keep holding companies accountable for recruiting women into their boards and into senior managment .
A few matters are not on this agenda. They include legislated affirmative action and pay-equity programs, zero-tolerance sexual harassment codes, universal day care, condemnation of new reproductive technologies, fight against pornography and few more. Women's groups have wasted much time and money on these issues, which are marginal for women's well-being and are being conected with bad and ideological baggage .
There were days when sensible women and men from all the spectrum of opinion and belief united for real, progressive and thoughtful work for change. Could it happen again ?
