Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is the root of all evil. Symbolicaly taken, yes it is .
First we must define what money is and what it means to people It is a sibstitute for property. Money itself doesn ' t worth anything as well as gold and other precious materials. And property in fact ensures the life. And the desire to survive is the basic and strongest instinct of any being , including people. In adition to this , in the animals world the power is based on physical abilities, while in the human world the power depends on finantial possibilities, on the amount of wealth. It is an endless process, a circle in fact. People will do anything for money - it will give them power - power to make other people to do something - for money of course. And we are back again , because people will do anything for money .
People are imprisoned in this circulation of money and there is no way out. People, who try to escape will just dig through into another cell. I mean the area of religion or education .
Their hierarchy of their qualities is shifted some way. It is different in many ways, some would say it is more derveloped, less primitive, but the basic function is the same. I. e. these prisoners also desire to be more powerfol than the rest is .
Human nature is to own things that will make their life easier and more pleasant. Looking at the problem from the historical view we can hardly find the breakpoint - the first use of money and it is even more difficult to date when the people in primitive societies started to diferentiate according to their wealth. the first properties were probably a female partner and a piece of land. these two basic possessions can be observed also in the animals world and they in fact are the basis of all fights. It is not correct to say t they are the root of all evil because it Â¡is only natural law. But a few thousand years later there came different properties such as a shelter, a primitive weapon and finaly the most important thing - the fire. Fire is the first sign of civilisation plays an important role in the human society developement. The group who had lost their fire could hardly survive. And the desire to survive is the strongest instinct. Thats why here start the fights and here starts the evil. And because Man is thinking and developing creature he brought the evil to extraordinary perfectness. He invented money that can substitute any thing .
Some would say that you can t buy love which is at least a subject of discussion. The only thing that is absolutely out of the power of money is time. People howewer rich they are, are getting old and they never can buy their youth again. Some would say that getting old, weak, the ilnesses etc. is evil that hasn't been caused by money and the statement wouldn't be true but the process of living and dying is only natural and we cannot consider it evil. Evil is just a product of human mind and activity - the wrong side of his inteligence. There cannot be evil among animals, what seems to be cruel and bad to us is never a product of selfishness, envy and hatred but only natural law of life and love of life as well .
So we can agree. Yes, money is really the root of all evil, it causes all fights and struggles. But on the other hand these are part of human charakteristics and the same power ( i. e. the desire to know, to own and to rule ) that causes all the evil is the engine of all progress and civilisation. And it will go forward whatever we want or do. So it is necessary to build up a system that would minimalise this evil .
