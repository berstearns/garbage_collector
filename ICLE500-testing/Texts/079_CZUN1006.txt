Title:: All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service 

I am a woman. I do not have to go to an army and spend there twelve months .
Twelve months of doing nothing. You earn no money besides a few hundred crowns of soldiers'pay. If you have a family or some property like a flat that must be paid monthly than you have a problem. In our republic these problems are still not solved. I have a personal experience with it. I am 22 and my boyfriend serves in military service as same as many other boys of his age that have no serious reason why not to be there. He has a new flat. He could not allow regretting it because problems are not only in an army resort but also with housing shortage. His mother pays the rent. She is single and must support his younger brother that stills studies. Our government pays a half of the amount but what if his mother could not have been able to pay? Czech republic is preparing to enter NATO. Our army must answer certain requests. This requires money. Money that is needed in every resort and army is not the most important one. It appears in many regiments. This is why my boyfriend spends a useless year in his regiment. He is doing nothing there. He learns nothing new, nothing that will help him in case of an attack. In my opinion, a meaning of an army is to protect people and country that are attacked. Young men who are made to go to Czech military service are about 18 or 19 years old and they spend a year of their lives there and they are to learn a basic knowledge about weapons, strategy and about how to behave in critical situation. I want to believe that in most of the regiments it already works this way. In the regiment where my boyfriend serves it is still going the old way. Soldiers from this regiment are to keep guard over oil-tanks. They keep guarding and keep guarding and doing nothing else. I cannot help myself but I thing it is really a restless year. Nevertheless, I believe that in today's world it is necessary to have a professional army as same as a military service. People should know how to protect themselves and homes and families. Although you can object that in our times only one bomb can be enough to destroy everything and the only thing that remains is the hope. But I guess that it is always better to feel prepared. I did not think like that a few months ago. I believed is a safe place to live where people sometimes do fight but that these conflicts are so far from our country that they cannot influence our lives. Later on I found out that our Earth is a very small place where any step even the smallest one influences events that follow. Conflicts that take place ex-Yugoslavia, in Iraqi or between Israel and Palestine or in some African states are not that far. They are also our business. Since the time when I started to watch TV news more carefully I am still more and more afraid about what can happen. I feel like if people are standing on the edge and now they must decide which way to go. Fights, wars and other conflicts just waste time and the time are not inexhaustible. I think that solving these problems is a priority. Countries that are rich must try to help those poor ones that can be easy spoils for aggressive countries. That is why I think that at least men must be prepared because we must show that we are. able to protect our selves. I wish I were more optimistic. Even though I am not a religious person I believe in some higher power that is above us and follows us. We must help our selves alone. Our lives are in our hands .
