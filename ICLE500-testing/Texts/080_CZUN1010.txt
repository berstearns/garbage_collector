Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
When television was born in the early 20 s, new era of life started to develop. At the beginning only rich people owned TV sets as it was very expensive. At that time broadcasting took only several hours a day, but it was enough for people who eagerly sat in front of " telly" and watched programmes which were presented. It was like a miracle for them to have TV at home because they knew the screen only from cinema. No matter if it was news programme or a film people watched the programme with enthusiasm and expectation. Gradually more people could afford a TV set. Those who were not still able to buy " the miracle" began to visit their friends to watch a programme. It obviously became a special event. As the technological progress continued, the broadcasting got longer and the programmes were better. Regardless the age, viewers looked forward to daily programmes. Everybody found his or her favourite programme. TV started with one or two channel broadcasting and later expanded the offer. That fact drew attention of more and more viewers and more TV sets were bought. Broadcasting in black and white changed into coloured, mono was replaced by stereo sound. At one time nearly every family had their own TV.
In the present time when satellite receiver and video player are used there are cases in which people become addicted to watching TV. They watch television right after they come from school or work and stop being interested in what they were before. In consequence of that people don t go to theatres, cinemas or other cultural and sport events so often. Real sportsmen become passive sportsmen. Significant time on TV is taken by commercials. It is very often a favourite talking point. People talk about funny, crazy or awkward advertisements. They even try to imitate them. On the other hand we should not forget to mention the good influence of watching TV but only if a viewer chooses a certain programme and watches for limited time. No doubt there are programmes which are educational and especially children can broaden their minds. Competitions are one of the most favourite programmes which reguest knowledge. Another popular programmes which are much appreciated by viewers of all ages are programmes about nature. Particularly people from towns are eager for that kind of production. News programmes have also much attention as the viewers learn about their country and the whole world. Sport events draw attention of men in particular. There is a very positive feature, thanks to science and technology, that enables to deaf people to watch TV. Special programmes are provided with subtitles or sign-language. Hopefully every viewer, even the serious one, is able to choose a programme, ranging from education, entertainment, films to music and sport, that will satisfy him. There is also a great number of TV series that people all around the world are crazy about and when the certain programme starts the fans leave other activity and stick around TV. On the other hand viewers are influenced by broadcasting in negative way it concerns especially the young generation. The worst are violent and brutal films which evoke similar behaviour and the youngsters become dangerous to their surroundings .
All in all, television is very important in our life. It depends if we will make use of it or will become slaves of that mass media .
