Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
In six months time the incredible student life will be over again for some people .
They will set foot in the real world and start working in the field of their studies, at least that is what they hope for .
But will these students find work immediately and will it be in the right field, meaning will they get a function according to their training?
Recent statistics show that the unemployment figure in Belgium has dropped slightly, compared to A992-1993. This, however, does not mean that whenever a person graduates he is offered a job right a way. The tendency nowadays in Belfium is that the majority of gradautes have to wait for about six months before they are hired under the [Quotation] (a governmental initiative helping young people to find a job).
In many cases they are fired after six months and have to start all over again .
This of course is a very annoying situation, but what, to me, is even more annoying, is the fact that "experience" is always required .
Just fold the newspaper open and take a look at job advertisements; you will rarely find an add where a person with no experience qualifies the prospect .
My question then is, "how can a just graduated, fresh ex-student, have experience"?
Let us look at the translators/interpreting section for example. It seems that most colleges or universities for translators and interpreters are not familiar with the situation of apprenticeships, contrary to the hotelmanagement section, where students can go abroad for four months and work in hotels .
Future social workers and nurses also have to work in their branch for a certain period and are evaluated then .
Would it not be better for all colleges and universities to introduce these apprenticeships, so that students are already aware of what they are getting into, instead of just throwing them to the wolves when they graduate?
Now we have come to the issue of doing exams in order to pas. For some courses the situation of permanent evaluation already exists, but for most subjects you still have to take an exam .
Is this a fair system?
In my opinion it is not, because you are evaluated on two or three questions taken from a book of maybe threehundred pages. If you are lucky you can answer these questions. If not, too bad, then you are nicely invited to take your exam again in September, even though you knew the rest of your book perfectly well .
In my opinion apprenticeships and permanent evaluation are the perfect solution; you are judged by experts in the field, who can keep an eye on you all day, whereas at college or university a professor has to spread his or her time over 20 students or more .
The conclusion we can only make is that universities and colleges really have to take action to reform these situations, not today but yesterday .
