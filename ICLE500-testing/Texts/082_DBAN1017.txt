Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
The latest years it has become very difficult to find a job. It is often even moredifficult to find a job if you have a university degree than if you have a lower one. Is this because most university degrees are theoretical and therefore do not prepare students enough for the real world?
It is true that people who are for example a plumber or a technician do not need a university diploma and they can often find a job after they have finished their secondary school. These people are indeed trained to practise a certain profession and most of the time they have to do a work placement during their training .
People who have a university degree, on the other hand, have almost or no practise during their education, the only thing they have are a lot of books or courses they have to know by heart. Unfortunately, students at a university also do not do a work placement in their last year .
I think it is a pity that most university education do not have a work placement for their students in their last year, but if that really is not possible, I think the students themselves shoud have to prepare for the real world. There are several ways to do so .
In the first place, the students can prepare by acquiring knowledge about all kinds of things. During their student days, they should read a lot of books, newspapers and magazines. That way they learn a lot about politics, economics, culture and so on. The school can not learn you all these things, but you need to have a general knowledge if you want to become a part of the real world .
Secondly, the students should insert a work placement themselves. They can, for example, go studying at a university in another country for one year, take a course abroad for a month during the holidays or do a holiday job in a company. By doing a holiday job they learn what real life is all about, they get to know life in a company and moreover they earn some money .
In the third place, I think that students should not only learn their books and courses by heart because they have to know the material for the exams, but they should really try to see the importance of all the things they learn for later life. Unfortunately, some students keep studying only for the exams and do not see the importance of a general knowledge .
To conclude, I agree that university degrees are too theoretical and therefore they do not prepare students enough for the real world. But university degrees are not at all of little value if the students themselves complement their studies with some general knowledge, a course abroad or a vacation job. Besides, in my opinion, one of the characteristics of a university degree is that the people who have it are independent people, who are, with or without a lot of practical training, very ready for the real world .
