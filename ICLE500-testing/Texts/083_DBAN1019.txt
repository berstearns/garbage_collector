Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Religion is the opium for the masses. According to Feuerbach, humanity cannot find salvation unless religion is abolished. Marx did not share his opinion. He claimed religion to be the opium form the masses. If he had lived nowadays, he would have replaced religion by television .
People have a need to be entertained. Religion used to be a form of entertainment, when belief was still strong and people went to church every day. Nowadays, television takes over this role. Instead of spending our evenings outdoors, we prefer to sit in front of our TV-set, switch off our brains and watch whatever programme we are offered. Therefore we could call television the babysitter for adults, and certainly for the elderly people. They often are lonely, but, like every human being, need some kind of conversation now and again. That is why they really need a TV-set .
Another obvious similarity between religion and television is the fact that they address us on the same level; namely that of a thirteen-year old kid. This may sound pretty rude, but it is true! If television stations raised their level, people would be unable to follow and would not longer pay attention to it. Television once again took over the part of religion: giving uncomplicated answers to complex questions. Everything men did not understand, used to be attributed to the gods. But men became smarter and found more logical answers to those matters that were not to be understood. Technology grew and created its own god; it was called television and it was invented for the same purpose as religion: to keep the mass stupid and tomake sure that people do not think .
During the inquisition, too many innocents were killed because the catholic Church suspected them to be devil-worshipers. It was a time where everyone distrusted everyone, only because the Church wanted them to .
Television has this very same, frightening power to manipulated people and to mobilize them. Just think of the images some years ago of the Ethiopian children. Suddenly, everyone was ready to give donations and to dedicate themselves to help the poor and the hungry. But now, at this very moment, the situation has not changed and still hundreds of people die in Ethiopia every day. Another example: Americans used tothink the Chinese were creepy little men, not to be trusted, evil, etc... But then television showed their very president Nixon shaking hands with Mao, and all of a sudden, the Chinese were very wise men with an ancient and important culture. This proves that TV can really influence people, whether it is good or bad, just like any religion .
Religion reshapes reality the way it wants it to be. Who is stupid enough to believe that Jesus actually walked on the water, or fed hundreds of people with only five loaves of bread and two fish? Well, those converted to Catholicism could believe this because it says so in the Bible. Television too recasts reality. What impression of a report on famine remains, if it is interrupted every ten minutes by commercials that show us all the best food in the world. No one will believe in the end that famine is possible! All the important facts that can be transmitted become faint due to a permanent fragmentation of those very facts .
It is obvious that nowadays Marx would replace religion by television. All the similarities are there, and less people go to church, while more and more television sets are being sold. And why would one go to church, if he can, every Sunday morning, attend cabled Mass? Opium from the masses, remember?
