Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
In our society , religion used to be very important for the people. In the older days, almost everyone believed in God. God used to be their source of inspiration, their support. In those days, people were religious, not only because they really believe, but also because it was a moral tradition and obligation for them to believe in God. Otherwise they feared to be pointed at by their neighbours and friends .
Peole went to church every Sunday. They used to pray a lot. For instance, when there was a thunderstorm, people prayed for the thunderstorm to go away. They also prayed before dinner to thank God for their meal .
Nowadays, those aspects are more or less gone. People do not go to church that often anymore. A lot of people want to believe that they are good christians. They baptize their children when born; they do their first and solemn communion; they marry in church; but actually you only see them twice a year in church: at Easter and with Christmas .
To come back to the aspect of marriage: when people got married in the older days, it was [Quotation] . So it was an important step in life. Nowadays, marriage is still important, but if it does not work out, people do not hesitate to get a divorce. Divorce is not such a taboo anymore. It seems as if you can get a divorce every day .
Of course, in this essay, I deal with some aspects of christianity. I do not say that this phenomenon occurs in every religion. These days, you still have a few strong religions e.g. the Islam and Buddhism .
It is possible that the weakening of christianity can be attributed to evolution, and especially to the advent of the television. This medium has an enormous influence on people. It is like opium for the masses but in another way. This is not the case with television. The good thing about television is that it provides us information: documentaries,... but also things that happen around the world. So in fact, it replaces the radio. But, unfortunately, television also has a bad influence. On television, you can see a lot of violence. May be that is one of the reasons why violence has increased during the last years. Violence on television also has an influence on children. They want to imitate people on television because they are not aware of what is right or wrong. In this way accidents happen. I think that television replaces in one way or the other our religion. But this phenomenon is therefore not so good. Violence has always existed in our society but still it has increased a lot and I think that is partly due to the television .
