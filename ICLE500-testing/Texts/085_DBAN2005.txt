Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
In this essay I would like to talk about the negative aspects of money. Money causes a lot of trouble in the world: robberies, envy, damage to the environment etc.. Also war and politics go together with money. Money is often considered as the key to all doors, but on the other hand we all know the saying: [Quotation] . Let's have a look on its role in society and the negative consequences .
Money plays an important role these days. Even children are already confronted with the value of money. When you ask a child what he or she wants to become when it's grown up, you often get the answer: "rich". The importance of money is taught at a very young age and it doesn't leave our mind. Money is also considered to be equal to power. Someone who is rich, is powerful and when you are poor, you have nothing to say. So then you have the problem of classdifferences: upper class with power and lower class with no power. Already in early ages we saw this phenomenon. Money has always been a problem and it always will be. This is a very materialistic world, people think in a very materialistic way and there is nothing you can do about it .
Because of this material world and the importance of money, new problems keep arising. First of all there is robbery .
Everyday, if we have a look in the newspapers, we read about robbery: people who are violently being robbed, banks that get unwanted visitors who want all the money that doesn't belong to them, and also shops are confronted with this problem .
So why do people steal? Easy. Because they don't have any money and money is something you cannot live without. If you want to survive you need money. Of course not only poor people go stealing. A lot of people steal because they are envious or they get a kick by doing it .
Secondly, there is the problem of drugs. We all know that it costs quite a lot of money to buy drugs. Not all the addicts can afford this, so the only solution is robbery. But that's not the only problem. Drugs have one meaning, namely the big chiefs who earn fortunes by selling it. They are only interested in one thing: making as much money as possible and they don't care about all the misery that goes along with it: addicted people, overdoses, family problems etc.. The mere thing they want is to get rich .
Another issue is the environment. Why is the existence of several animals threatened? Easy. Because of money of course. Take the example of the elephants. The only reason why they are slaughtered are the ivory tusks. Ivory is sold for enormous amounts of money. Another example are the seals that are beaten to death because of their fur, which is used for coats and such. Then there are the Japanese who are fervent whale catchers. They don't just eat the whale fish. Some stuff in their brains is used for cosmetics and also "amber" in their intestines, is very very expensive. If they keep on hunting, there'll probably be no whale to catch in a couple of years .
But they don't think about that. All these people don't care about the fact that they are destroying nature. They only look at the reward they will get for their efforts, namely - yes - money, lots of money .
There are a number of other areas in which money is involved. Think about kidnapping. Sometimes there's a whole affair involved in a kidnapping case, which is not meant for the public to know about. But the main point is again money, large amounts of money, like in the Anthony De Clerck affair .
Also politics (Agusta affair) and war have to do with this evil thing .
So I don't think you can come up with positive aspects of money. It's easy if you have it, you can buy whatever you want. If people are willing then third world coutries can be given food, material etrc. to survive. But most of these countries are in trouble because of a corrupt government. Look at Mobutu: his people were starving, but he preferred to build an expensive palace or bridge, rather than to feed his country .
In fact you can look at this as a circle: one thing causes another. There's nothing you can do about it, unfortunately. People will always want money. This idea maybe isn't so bad itself, but it is a pity we have to pay a price for it .
