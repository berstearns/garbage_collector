Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
A long time ago, a family, or even a whole village, gathered at night to spend their evenings together after a hard day's work. They made music and danced; they told stories and the children played games. When it got dark, everyone (or almost everyone) went to sleep to get a good night's rest before starting another day's work early in the morning. In the winter people didn't go out very much; they spent the evenings close to the fireside, the women knitting and sewing, the men smoking their pipes or carving a toy out of wood .
When electric light was invented, people tended to stay at home more often and to stay up later. They took advantage of the fact that they could enjoy the light as long as they wanted. They still spent the evenings in family, but started doing other things: playing cards or other party games, reading a book or the paper if they could read, listening to the radio when that was invented, etc... People in the villages tended to spend less and less time in each other's company, and in the cities this situation was even worse (because cities are more often than not, less social than cosy little villages).
When television was invented and the greater part of the population could afford it, it got to be a new and very easy way to entertain oneself: after a hard day's work in a factory or somewhere else, most people were too tired to do anything and it was very easy to just sit down, put your feet up and let someone turn on the telly .
That is when television industry started producing all kinds of series and shows that would go down easily and that don't ask for a lot of effort on the part of the public. This practice started in America (like many other things, good or bad, do) and spread around the world. And it continues up to this very day, except for the fact that it has all become even more sophisticated and less primitive in a lot of areas .
An incredible number of soap series, some more successful than others, have been created with the sole purpose of entertaining people. Some of these series are of a higher quality than oters, but these aren't always the most successful ones; they often don't last longer than one season .
Almost every single one of these series is based on the same ideas: a group of people, mostly a family, in a particular place, and a number of problems and intrigues, very often because of love affairs or money, that these people have to deal with .
The remarkable thing is that most people don't seem to get sick and tired of seeing the same things happening over and over again. But then again, most people love to stick their nose in other people's affairs, and that is exactly what they can do in those series .
Soap series and game shows seem to appeal to all people all over the world. Even in Third World countries, where people hardly ahve any money, they often have a television set, even if only one for a whole village. And you can then see those people, gathered in a hut, very attentively watching ' Dallas' or ' Dynasty ' or another flashy, glamorous series that the country's television company could buy cheaply. It nevertheless seems a bit illogical and ironic that those people seem to be able to afford a television set and at the same time have got almost nothing to eat .
In short, nowadays many people spend their evenings in front of their television set, without talking(=communicating) at all. And if there still is someone who dares to comment upon something that happens on TV, he/she is told to 'shut up, I am trying to watch that film!'
Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was still alive at the end of the twentieth century, he would probably change his opinion and say that now television is the opium of the masses .
