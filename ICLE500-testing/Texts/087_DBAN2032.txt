Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
In Belgium, we have to make a distinction between university and HOBU (higher education on academic level). The difference between these two is the HOBU is a bit more practical. Still, a lot of theory is taught to get a wide knowledge of the world. When you want to become an interpreter, for example, you go to HOBU. You have to make a lot of translations; this is the practical side. But you also get a lot of theoretical courses, for example, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology... The problem today is, especially for university students, that they only have had theoretical courses. They have a big knowledge but they did not get on-the-job training. They do not know how to use their knowledge in practice .
But why is this such a big proglem?
Well, nowadays, employers always want to engage someone with an adequate certificate. But more important is that the applicant has experience. He should have worked, for example, in the same kind of company before, or he should at least have done a work placement in the same branch .
For those who graduated as a teacher or those who have studied German or Ramance Philology it is not such a big problem because they are obliged to do a teaching practice .
for the others, on the other hand, who just graduated, it is very difficult to find a job. there is a lot of unemployment and people who are experienced, often older people, are favoured. That is why I think that university degrees are a bit useless . (but not at all of very little value). It is the experience that counts .
What can we do about it?
Universities and colleges (HOBU) should give their students the possibility to do a work placement but only for those who are interested. It should not be obligatory. In that way the students could do that work placement and write a report about it. And maybe they could write a thesis about that term of probation. If they are looking for a job later, they would not have many problems because they have experience. It is even possible that they can stay with the company they have worked with. Besides, it would also be a good thing for companies because they do not have to pay these workforces. I think this would be a much better kind of instruction than writing a pure theoretical thesis. We must though not neglect theoretical instruction. Practice and theory should go side by side .
