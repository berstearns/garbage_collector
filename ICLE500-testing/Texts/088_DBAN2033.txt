Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
How sad but true this is! Money and power, science technology and economy, industrialisation and education are the things that really matter in our society. Nowadays dreaming and imagination are becoming more and more second-rate. Our priorities seem to have gone through some changes .
Power, money, technology... are the criteria for 'success' in life and for just being heard and respected. Without success you are nothing in this society. what is striking is, that we seem to have forgotten what it means to be truly happy. We confuse success with happiness. No doubt happiness cannot possibly be obtained without dreams and imagination, without feelings and emotions. Nowadays everything is insensitive, cold, unfeeling..., which is a big problem in our society. There is this fight for survival, everybody on its own in the big bad world. Feelings are inconvenient, superfluous in all aspects of life. They are considered to be the ' things' that hold you back. This is especially the case in business, which is no doubt a dominant factor in our society . ' Business is business' has become a common notion. There is no place for compation, charity, the same way that there is no place for dreaming and imagination. It all boils down to making a profit, productivity, accomplishment .
There is also a lack of time for dreaming, imagination and plain creativity. Our days are carefully planned and more than filled (the rush of daily life). Sure, we still dream but almost only at night, unconscious of it. by the time we have woken up we have forgotten all about it. It does not interest us anymore, we have other things on our minds like work, school, appointments...money, money, money. People get caught in this mill of things and do not see any way out .
Imagination and dreaming are a form of freedom where natural boundaries are exceeded. In our imagination we bare our souls, either conscious or not, with its desires, fears and creative possibilities. Imaginaiton is an introspective tool. We are in a world then where our minds take a broad sweep, where it is not relevant whether or not something is realised, or if problems are solved or created. Imagination is also not something we can force upon ourselves. But it is a necessity for humans to be whole. It is one of the things that distinguishes us from other living creatures .
The negligence of the importance of dreaming and imagination is prevalent at all ages. Even toys nowadays do not leave much to imagination. The more complicated, artificial (supplied with technical devices) the better. Children do not really play anymore. They are no longer creative. They are handed these ' revolutionary ' toys or just put in front of the television in order to keep them busy. This is very passive without the development of the personality or the mind .
People in general spend a considerable amount of time watching TV, which is at the expense of other leisure activities. It has also been proven that TV steals time which would otherwise have been spend on imagination. TV is an ' easy ' medium which requires little mental effort. This leads to a passive ' let you entertain me'-attitude which undermines the willingness to think something up ourselves. TV also undermines the ability to focus your attention on something for quite a long time, which is needed for imagination. TV leads to over-excitement, impulsive thinking, a reduction of attention and restless behaviour. This is also determined by the kind of programmes we watch . ' Kind ' programmes leave our imagination undisturbed. Programmes with much violence and action, however, are adverse on our imagination .
It is really a shame, that we seem to choose for a life without imagination or dreaming. Is happiness not to be found in our minds and hearts rather than in material things, our bank account...? Chateaubriand once said that true happiness is to be found in little things, that if it costs much it is not of the right kind. Our priorities and values in life have changed. We need scientific arguments, proof before we believe in something. We are all very much involved in trying to make something of our lives without really living, experiencing it. We do not seem to care about dreaming and imagination because we believe that it does not provide us with something. Or is this my ' imagination'?
