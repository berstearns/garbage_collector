Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Nowadays, it seems as if money is the most important thing on earth. A lot of people already have a full-time job, but they still go out working in the evenings. And all for one reason: money .
People have become too materialistic anyway. I certainly have to admit that it can be handy to be rich: you can buy everything you want; washing machines, dishwashers, CD-players, video's, cars, or what so ever .
But if you ask me, money isn't the key to happiness at all. I think money offers you more dis - than advantages .
If you become rich, the danger exists that you become more and more egoïstic. But another problem is that rich people can become extremely powerful, especially because they can afford everything. An example of this was Saddam Houssein, the offender of the Gulf War. That man was so rich, that he even didn't know how much he possessed. But because of his large amounts of money, he was able to put pressure on the whole world and he was frightened by everybody. So, you see: money is the root of all evil .
It also has to be very difficult to have a relation, if you are rich. You always have to wonder whether your partner loves you or just your money. And who are your real friends? You always have to doubt about this sorts of things. Other persons may also have this problem, but money certainly makes things more complicated .
Rich people often want more and more money. They would do anything to become richer .
Therefore, it doesn't have to surprise you that riche people can become criminals. they betray other people and even grow richer. I think it is very dreadful that a lot of people don't see the little but so beautiful things in life anymore. They don't see the flowers and the trees and the bees anymore. They are only occupied with themselves .
And what's far more terrible, is that those rich people are respected by the others. They believe that those people have to know a lot, because they are that rich. Well, they are wrong. Cleverness doesn't have anything to do with money at all. Although those rich ones also know this, they often discriminate other people. Sometimes, they behave like they were God .
So far, I have described the rich people as egoïstic. But this certainly doesn't mean that this is a general statement .
Rich people, who want to share their money with others; people, who want to give money to charity funds or what so ever... Well, they are OK. You may have lots of money, as long as you stay simple, you're on the good way .
But I wouldn't like to be in the place of these people either. Having a lot of money also has its consequences .
It isn't the first time, a rich man is kidnapped. You also have to be more frightened on the street. Because people are able to see whether you are rich or not .
For all these reasons, I believe, it's much better to stay simple. If you ask me, you'll enjoy life much more!!!!!
