Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
People who agree with this statement generally believe that the only board woment are fit for is the drain-board. Whereas others will get annoyed just reading the title. They argue that women have to be radical in their approach to become the equal of the men. We are getting there, yet maybe a little bit too slow .
This brings us to the question:"What does feminism really stands for?" the women's movement aspires to improve the position of the woman in the cultural, economic, social, and political field. Assuming naturally that women are considered less important than men. There were two feministic avalanches: On the one hand there was one that started at the end of the nineteenth century, and on the other hand a feministic avalanch began in the late sixties .
The ideology of the Women's Liberation Movement has three main tendencies: Firstly there is the reformative or "civil rights"-feminism. They strive for the granting of equal rights to women. In other words women emancipation .
Secondly we have radical feminism or women's liberation, they want to do away with the standards, values and patterns of behaviour that continue to make women inferior to men. Finally there is also socialistic feminism. They aim at the liberation of women linked to the struggle against the inequality between the social classes. These three tendencies all strive after equality, liberation, emancipation, etc. on the cultural, economic, social and political area. The cultural position of the women has won more and more prestige the last few years. Painters, writers, actrices, singers, models, ..., they all obtained a certain Hollywood status. A lot of them are the symbols of emancipated and liberated women. they can even be considered to be superior where models (and other areas) are concerned .
On the contrary, the married women's social position in society has not changed much. Women are still doing the housework and taking care of the children, even though they may have a job. But unmarried and divorced women are now becoming more independed. Two tendencies can be noted: A lot of women want to have a career of some kind so that they get out once in a while and not be financially depended on their life partner. They still have to fight twice as hard to achieve the same goal than a man. Some men though choose to be houseman while their wifes go out to work. The above-mentioned is still a taboo that has to be broken. To conclude we can say that the social position is "gradually" improving .
Finally, there is the women's political position. More and more women are interested in politics and want to go into politics. The last few years we have seen an increse in women politicians. Some parties see it as a new kind of political propaganda to put women in important positions, but they still form less than ten percent of all the politicians. So the increase in women politicians should be strongly encouraged .
To conclude, the Women's Liberation Movement strives for equal rights, liberation and emancipation. They not only want it in the social, economic, cultural field, but also in the political field. All women, even men, should devote themselves to this necessity. So that the the only board women are fit for is NOT the dran-board .
