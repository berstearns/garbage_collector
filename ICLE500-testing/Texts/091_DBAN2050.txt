Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money, money; money... The keyword of our modern society. When you ask someone about his greatest dream he probably will answer you: [Quotation] . People attach great importance to material wealth. When they don't have all of this they think they're poor and that their life is meaningless. They are unhappy and unsatisfied. Manu people want to lead a life of luxury without doing a thing, they don't want to tire themselves out with working all day. They aren't motivated anymore to do their job .
One of the reasons people get divorced is that they spend all their money on beautiful, material things; they buy expensive clothes, they go on holiday, buy a new car,... And suddenly they realize that they don't have enough money to continue to live like that. They can not adapt to that more "normal life", they're unsatisfied and they leave each other .
Three or four decades ago, people were pleased when they got a roof over their head and the opportunity to feed their children and themselves. They thanked God the war had come to an end. Little presents brought real happiness, real appreciation in to the house .
Nowadays, children aren't grateful anymore when they get heaps of expensive playthings like computer games, little cars remote control, doll's houses, Barbie yachts,...
The enormous desire for money has resulted in robbery and burglary. When they can't or won't pay for the thing they want, they just steal it. The terrifying thing is that not only poor, I mean very poor streetpeople steal but also the rich, who can afford it, don't think nothing of it. They just want more and more, they never have enough, whereas streetpeople have to steal in order to have something to eat. To some, stealing is an obsession; they can't stop it anymore .
How many haven't become bankrupt because of gambling in casinoes or fun-fairs? They too were addicted to money but it got them into a miserable life. Result: they enter the world of alcoholism and drugs .
Another shocking thing is that their doesn't seem to exist kindness among friends anymore. In the past, almost everybody was prepared to extend help for free to friends and relatives. It was normal, it obvious. This statement doesn't hold anymore. People see money everywhere. They hardly help each other .
A final sad situation has to do with "money business" It very oftens happens today that people are bribed by others to obtain what that other really wants. What terrifies me is that judicial authorities are given thousands of Belgian franks to defend a case in favour of a person who, may be, is guilty of murder, of robbery or who has commited forgery. He goes free and will probably commit the same crime again .
People aren't honest with each other. They lie, they cheat, they steal... And all this because of money, only for the image. As the saying goes: [Quotation] .
