Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
In this essay I seek to demonstrate that it is only thanks to several feminist movements in modern Western civilization that men and women have, at least theoretically, equal rights .
Feminist or women's movements advocate same rights and chances for men and women. They try to change the present system to give women equality with men, especially in the cultural, economic and juridical areas .
These movements also want traditional role patterns to be broken down. in my opinion, many feminists grossly oversimplify these traditional role patterns when they reduce them to a matter of social convention. The difference between men and women is basically natural, it is not merely culturally, i.e. artificially, determined. In primitive life, man's natural superior strength provided protection to women, particularly while they were in the final stages of their pregnancy. This of course does not mean women are inferior to men. Political equality for every human being, man or woman, black or white, is desirable and necessary. In this context the concept "gender" is often used . "Gender" is the sex which nature has imposed upon us, it is unchangeable, we must accept it .
The problem is that women are often regarded as deviating from the male norm. It is only thanks to several great women and their accompanying movements that this norm is not as rigid anymore as it used to be. The first important feminist was the Romantic Mary Wollstonecraft, mother of Mary Shelley and author of ' A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'. Romanticism was a reaction against the preceding Enlightenment. An important idea of the Romantics was freedom of the individual, so freedom of the female individual as well .
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a group of women caused upheaval by chaining themselves to important buildings. These women called themselves ' Suffragettes': they fought for suffrage, i.e. the right to vote, for women. But the agitations did not have an immediate success. It was not until a few decades later their aim was achieved. Since then every grown-up woman has been able to vote .
Contemporary feminism developed from the postwar generation of the Sixties. From now on women occupy important positions in political, academic, cultural and economic business life. To exemplify this I only mention Margaret Thatcher, Simone de Beauvoir and Madonna .
But I do not want to give a rosy picture of how things really are. It is a fact that in everyday life men are still higher up on the social scale. For doing exactly the same job as their male colleagues, women often get paid less. The typical roles expected of women, such as staying home to take care of the children, are still taken for granted by many .
I conclude that women are still not politically equal to men, in spite of the various movements fighting for this cause. But I fear equality for all people is utopian: there will always be some who think they are superior to others .
I end with John Lennon's pun, being such an accurate rendering of reality: [Quotation]
