Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
I must say that I never really agreed with Marx's pronouncement upon religion, but the new version is in my opinion undoubtedly true .
Particularly commercial television companies are cramming us with the most ridiculous and irritating games, soaps and commercials. Ratings prevail over making good television, and companies that do want to make interesting programmes cannot cope with the competition and have to follow the line to survive .
Some television companies broadcast 24 hours a day, so why would you go out and have a walk or some exercise if there's a good movie on TV, why would you go to a football match if you can follow it, live of course, on the little screen in front of you? Who cares if there isn't a live atmosphere in your living-room, if you have can have a better view on the game?
And than there's this other little screen: the computer, which is maybe even worse. Children, from 6 years onwards, no longer play with Legosets or dolls, they prefer electric toys and of course a real computer with lots of games. Every toy manufacturer knows it is bad for the children's eyes and so, but all these little lights and sounds are so fascinating that children want it. Everything which requires a little imagination seems to be oppressed .
It's hard to find something that isn't done by computer nowadays, and it doesn't stop either. Some people already have the ' luxury ' of not having to go to their office to work. No, they can stay at home and do everything there on their own computer, which is connected with the main one in the office .
Soon, even shopping will be possible by computer, you just order what you want to have by typing it on the screen, it is transmitted to the computer of the shop, and it's delivered within a few hours. To put it in other words: it seems to be that everything is done to keep everybody in his comfortable seat (all day, if possible), with the result that people become afraid of one another, they become apathetic zombies who adore their TVset in the way they used to adore a god (for which there isn't any time left anymore). Wouldn't all this be a perfect scenario for a sequel to George Orwell's "1984"? I really believe that this particular future image is what we're heading for if we continue in the way we're doing now. It wouldn't be that hard for an ' evil force', as it is called, to brainstorm people by means of what they see on television. I wonder what Marx would say if he would be alive ...
A very little minority of people refuse to cooperate in all this by not buying a TV or a computer, simply on principle. I believe that one should have great respect for them. As a matter of fact they might be the only ones that are not (yet?) infected with one of the worst diseases of the 20th century .
