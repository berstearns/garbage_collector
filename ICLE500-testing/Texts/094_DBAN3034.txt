Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
It should be noted that one can be a feminist without feeling affinity for the wave of feminist ideas from the sixties upto now. In expressing their ideas through the years about equal rights for women, the feminists forgot the most important points: the basic principles and the basic differences between women and men. Feminists were so eager for result that they diregarded these basic points .
The basic principles of feminism, the things that are really important for women to achieve are equal wages for equal work, equal possibilities in education and upbringing and excellent cr√®ches and nursery schools. As long as these principles have not been attained, time must not be wasted on other, less important things. But as this is hard, unpleasant and unrewarding work, women prefer to sit down and chat about how ' bad ' men are instead of working on these socio-economic injustices .
With many feminists one recognizes a certain intolerance for people not agreeing with their ideas. But, as said before, one can be a feminist without agreeing with the ideas of the mass of feminists. A lot of the present feminism is modern preaching of what is permitted and what is not. If some women stay home and look after the children rather than go out into the hard life of business, they should be able to. Isn't it the right of every man or woman to be what he or she wants to be? Feminism mustn't put pressure on women. The present tendency is that a woman should be ashamed of preferring to stay home. The pressure before feminism ( [Quotation] ) has now turned into a pressure the other way around .
This is not to say it was better before. The good thing about feminism is that it gives women the courage to have an own identity. They can have own lives now. A woman is no longer dependent on a man .
That women should be represented in parliament is in itself a good idea. But they shouldn't be forced into it. If there are few women in parliament now, it partly depends on the fact that they are not ready for it yet. They will get there eventually .
In a marriage the partners should give each other the freedom to have their own lives. For a man to give his wife this possibility, he does not need feminism. This freedom of choice should be the basic idea of marriage .
In this discussion the feminists forgot something else, the basic differences between women and men. In Dutch this is nicely expressed in the words [Quotation] and [Quotation] . [Quotation] relates to laws and wages etc. In that respect man and women are equal . [Quotation] has to do with the fact that men and women will never be the same. In this way men and women are not equal .
The conclusion is that women should be able to choose and decide what they like best. They shouldn't be obstructed in any way. And perhaps we should let men be able to choose too?
