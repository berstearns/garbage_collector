Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Our society is said to be severely influenced by technology. Nowadays this influence is becoming so big that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This is mainly due to the fact that new technologies, such as virtual reality and interactive television, are being developped irresponsibly. With all this new technology, man does no longer have to think for himself, everything is done for him. You could say that these developments are all very good for mankind, but the problem is that man does no longer think, period .
In the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, people had to work so hard, just to keep themselves and their families alive, that there was no time left for dreaming or imagination. But then came technology, because of machines the work became much lighter, people could go on holiday once in a while and had plenty of time to fantasize and dream. In this respect technology has been a blessing for mankind. However this ' blessing ' has now taken on such proportions that for some people it becomes almost impossible to think and dream freely. Technology can be used to stimulate people, to make them form their own opinions, but all too often it is used to impose the opinions and convictions of the people who are in control, on people who are using the technology. From this viewpoint our world is beginning to resemble the worl that Orwell described in "1984", a society that is controlled by a few people who have all the means to manipulate other people in such a way that creativity and fantasy become impossible. If however our technology and media are used in a responsible, "well thoughout" manner, they will stimulate people to think, give them time to do something else than make money, so that free imagination and dreaming become possible .
There is a second danger connected with this technology. Nowadays it is becoming so strong that you can create your own personal reality with it (the so-called ' virtual reality ' technology). This means that people can create their private universe, in which they control everything, with a computer. This ' virtual reality ' gives so much power to fantasy and imagination that it can become very confusing. The user of this technology could take this fictive world for the real world and suffer a severe shock when he's brought back into the reality, and even worse, he could decide to live the most important part of his life in this ' fictive ' reality and live the life of a vegetable in our reality .
In short one could say that technology has certainly been a blessing for mankind. There should, however, be some control on it, too often man is abused by technology. It's high time to do something about the morbid growth of technology and to try and seek for a system that protects society and its members .
