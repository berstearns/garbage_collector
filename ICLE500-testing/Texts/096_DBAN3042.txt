Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
It has been said before that money is the root of all evil. Surely not all evil is due to money, but the far-reaching harm that is being done to individuals in our world has to be attributed to capitalism. The system has undoubtedly influenced human behaviour at the end of this millennium: capitalism has added greatly to the all encompassing paralysis of the world. This essay focuses not only on the influence of capitalism on the individual, but also on the artist and on art itself .
In the closing years of the 20th century the individual person finds himself surrounded by unnecessary misery and gross inequality. Our community does not take the individuals integrity into account. According to Ludien Goldman, a famous literary critic, it was the so-called new look capitalism that killed the intrinsic value of the individual. When at the beginning of this century the capital concentrated itself around a select number of entrepreneurs, the free trade turned into an economy of monopolies and trusts. In this new economic sustem, the individual had lost its central position. Unlike the 19th century liberalism, the new look capitalism did not allow individuals to take part in big business. As a result, passivity grew .
Consumption is one of the key-words in the capitalists dictionary. People are urged in various ways to buy products that can improve their standard of living, so that after a while those redundant products become indispensable. Riches alone make no man happy, although we live in a world in which wealth seems to be the initial goal of life. Consequently, a lot of people are blinded by the considerations of career and personal profit .
Now how does capitalism affect the artist? The artist, too, is an individual and for that reason has to be protected. He must be given full spatio-temporal freedom to exploit his creativity and genius in order to produce Art. The artist must keep his independency, although he is still part of a society - whether he likes it or not. This society however may not prevent him from expressing his thoughts freely and making hiw own choices .
Theoretically, capitalism gives people this freedom to choose. I have to disagree with this definition. This is the kind of statement that implies that the homeless in e.g. New York City are somehow being homeless of their own volition. In the capitalist system, if you have no money, you have no choice, and capitalism defines freedom as choice .
To conclude this short essay, I'll briefly touch upon the capitalist view of the relationship between art and commerce. I will not discuss the contents of Art. The central simplicity of capitalism is that if something makes a profit then it must be good. This kind of reasoning may do when we talk about hamburgers, or refrigerators, but not when we discuss art. Hundreds of books have been written on the criterions for art, but it is sure that sales potential can never be the sole criterion for art. Therefore I say that capitalism is threatening Art .
