Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Feminism is the political belief that women should have the same rights, power and opportunities that men have. The women's movement wants to improve the situation of women in political, economic, social and cultural respects. In these fields women have always been discriminated against .
Besides historical periods in which the position of women was relatively good, as in ancient Egypt and Rome, there were periods in which their situation was moderate or even bad, as in ancient Greece. During the Renaissance women led a comparitively good life and they were given a freer hand. From then on we see woman's position worsen .
In the eighteenth and nineteenth century the rich woman was forced to stay home doing really nothing, while the lower class woman had to work her fingers to the bone for little money. In this climate the first feminist protest was born .
If we compare the position of a woman in 1994 to that of her nineteenth century counterpart, we can conclude that feminists have already taken quite a step on the long way towards emancipation .
Today the right to vote seems self-evident to us. If women were disfranchised (almost) everybody would scream blue murder. Nevertheless, suffrage for women is a relatively recent phenomenon. In Britain women were given the vote for the first time in 1928 and the Belgian women could enter their votes only after the Second World War. In America, which did not used to be renowned as particularly kind to blacks, black men could go to the polls before white women enjoyed that same right. And countries like Belgium and the United States claimed to be democracies ...
In spite of obtaining suffrage, women's contribution to the political life has stayed strikingly more modest than men's. Yet we can see an evolution in the good direction. More and more political parties try to have an equal number of male and female candidates on their lists. Also the number of elected women seems to be increasing .
Emancipation of women needs more than changing laws. Feminists also react against behaviour patterns that continue the discrimination against women. They try to get rid of the steretoype of the woman as a mother, housewife and sex object .
The ideas of feminism are winning ground. Nowadays a lot of men take responsibility in the upbringing of the children and in the household .
Feminists have done a lot of good to the cause of women. But when I see how women are ' abused ' in publicity for water, soap, aspirins, light products and cars for big fellows, I think there is still a long way to go .
