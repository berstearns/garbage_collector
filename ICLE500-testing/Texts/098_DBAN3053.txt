Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Many people have a very negative idea of the women's liberation movement and have a lot of prejudices against it. They imagine that feminists are egoistic, ugly, frustrated, lesbian women. And the thought that feminism has done more harm than good to the cause of women often comes to their minds. However, if it hadn't been for some strong women who enchained this emancipation movement, how would have been the women's situation today ? Would we have a right to vote? And what about going to university or having a job ? If we have a look at the feminist movement from its beginning until now, it becomes clear that many positive changes have taken place thanks to feminists. One should also keep in mind that the present feminist movement is not one coherent organisation. There are several groups, all having their own views, own theories and own goals. The media often focalises on the most striking groups, on those feminists who attract attention by their radical actions, actions that are not always approved of by everybody. In this way some people may have a one-sided and negative view on feminism .
in the 19 th Century the first women's organisations arose. During this first period of feminism the women's liberation movement sought equal rights for women, regarding work, education and politics. The marriage articles ( a divorce was almost impossible at the time) and the laws concerning prostitution had to be altered. They also demanded information on contraception and of course a right to vote. In 1870 British wives got the right for property. In 1919 they were allowed to run for Parliament . Not until 1928 they got the right to vote, after a long strife of the suffragettes, Other countries followed this example .
This was just the beginning. In the 1960's a new sort of feminism showed up in the U.S.. A second period of feminism had dawned. From now on the women's liberation movement concentrated more on the women and less on political rights. The idea that women not only have to strife after the granting of equal rights ( women's emancipation but also after the abolition af the behaviour and thinking patterns that discriminated against women ( liberation ) gained more and more interest. These "new" feminists wanted to change the prevailing stereotypes of women as weak, passive and dependant individuals who are less rational and more emotional than men. Their goal was to obtain more freedom for women to work and an equal responsability for men and women in the houshold. They criticised the emphasis on women as objects of sexual desire in society. They wanted to broaden the selfawareness of women and the opportunities to the point of equality with men. Also the advancement of women's participation in political decision making and other areas of public life was important .
The U.S. declared 1975 as International Women's Year. Conscious-raising groups, women studies, pubs for women, houses for women, magazines for women ... originated. Things we consider now as self-evident. Still, the women's liberation movement meets a lot of resistance among men as well as women .
The diversity of the movement may cause some problems. All those different groups, all those disagreements and quarrels among feminists often make a bad impression on outsiders. It is difficult to put all these bits and pieces together. And of course not all parts are acceptable. On the other hand, because of the complexity of the women's situation today, it is perhaps not so bad that different groups try to handle tings in their own way. In general you could discern three groups (with fundamental differences): the middle-of-the-road feminists, the socialists and the radical feminists. The first group considers the structure of society as the oppressor of women. The social feminists mean that capitalism is the cause of the inequality. According to the third group, man is the oppressor, so women have to disengage themselves of the male society and they have to create a society of their own .
With this brief sketch of the development of the women's liberation movement and some of its achievements, I think that it is clear that some of the negative opinions on feminists are unfounded. Thanks to the feminist movement the women's place in society has approved. Many things (like the right to vote, magazines for women...) that we now find self-evident, didn't exist two centuries ago. The women's emancipation movement has done some great things but there is still a long way to go. We are unaware of the way in which some of our thoughts confirm the traditional patterns of men and women. The way in which we act and think has a lot to do with messages and examples we get from our birth on, unconscious. And it is difficult to change the unconscious things .
