Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Some people believe that university education is theoretical and therefore does not prepare students for the real world. In their view, the only knowledge universities give you is bookish knowledge, which you can hardly use in your future post. Hardly any attention is paid to the practical side of the education .
To a certain extent I agree with this-conviction. How many times do you find a company offering a job in an ad that doesn't ask for someone ' with experience's Not very often, I'm afraid. The reason why companies strongly insist on experienced people is probably that they have had bad experiences with newly graduated employees. I can easily imagine that companies prefer people with a lot of practical knowledge in their pockets. But where ever are students supposed to get those practical skills? In my opinion, university education is remiss in this respect .
To make these statements more concrete and to the point, I'll confine myself to philological trainings, like Germanic languages. Graduate teachers are not prepared for the hard world of education. They don't know how to quiet down a shouting and unruly class or which teaching method to use in order to get the best results. In short, they are not able to cope with certain practical problems. For no one has ever familiarized them with the practical side of the teaching job .
Too many people think that a teacher's task is to walk into the classroom, give his lesson and leave the classroom again. But there is so much more to it than meets the eye! If there is no order in the classroom, it's really not easy to teach. In view of such a situation, I think that a course in pedagogics would be of use to any teacher-to-be, for teaching also involves ' upbringing'. A teacher helps a young person to grow into a balanced and independent adult .
But not only students of philology who want a future in education need practical skills. Those who go for journalism or economics could use these skills as well. Most graduates of philology have never studied any economics in their whole lives, whereas they really should have a notion of it if they want to work in a company .
Seeing that students of philology go different ways after their education, I suggest the following adjustments of the university educational system. During the last year of any philological training, optional courses should be provided in education, journalism, economics, ... . Each student should decide for himself what his future plans are and select a course in accordance with those plans. Pedagogics, business economics, social skills, statistics and technical jargon should be some of the optional courses. In my view, it's extremely important that those courses should focus on practice. They should enable students to put their bookish theory into practice and to specialize in those things they will really need in their future jobs .
That way, university degrees will stand for high theoretical Ã nd practical knowledge .
Apparently universities are willing to do something about it. They want to introduce an extra teacher training year after philological trainings. But unfortunately the Minister of Education Luc Van den Bossche doesn't agree to this proposal. He is prepared to contribute his mite though, by offering the universities extra subsidy. It's a step in the right direction, but there is more to be done .
Comparing a university education with a secondary teacher training, lower level, you'll see a world of difference. Yet, students from university as well as from teachers' training college end up in the same boat when they choose for education! The difference: secondary teachers lower level are competent at writing on the blackboard, oral expression, preparing a lesson, ... . Moreover, they know everything about the educational system, which can't be said about university students .
In fine, universities could learn a lot from teachers' training colleges as far as the practical aspect is concerned. I think it would be a good thing to bring about a mixture of both types. As a consequence, some university studies might last a year longer, but that's the price we'll have to pay for a university degree with real value!
