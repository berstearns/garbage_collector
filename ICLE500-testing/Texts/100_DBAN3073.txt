Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
In our age we are used to it that everything is done for us, instead of by us. For everything we have some kind of machine, or we have someone else do it for us. It seems people have lost their imagination, their ingenuity. Is this really so ?
Art, for instance, is a skill for which imagination is a central necessity. There are still lots of people going to art schools or performing some art or another. A lot of resourcefulness is definately required, because after 2000 years of civilisation it is very hard to be original, to become a bright star in the over-crowded sky. It's not only harder now than in former days , but also different, because the medium of art has changed ; not yet a century ago, people used to sit down and consume lots of poetry and prose, and now books are more or less replaced by television and movies, and in the near future we'll have interactive television and visual reality. A change of medium also requires a change in thinking. To make television programs, or to direct a movie involves a complete new kind of ingenuity. Because of new technologies, people are forced to invent new forms of art, they have to adapt. industrialisation gives new forms of imagination .
Industrialisation and resourcefulness also go together the other way around : without the dreams of some strange inventors, very handy discoveries would probably not have been made... Nowadays we can travel easily from one continent to another, but this wouldn't have been true if two brothers hadn't dreamed about flying like a bird in the sky. We wouldn't even have known America if in the 15th century someone didn't have a crazy idea to sail in another direction than usually! It is true that nowadays it seems that for every question there is a computer to answer it, and for every default a machine to fix it, but there are still far more unsolvable problems than ways to solve them. People will always search and search, and sometimes great discoveries will be made by pure scientific means only, but, there will always be dreaming inventors that from time to time find something very useful also .
We hear people complain that today's children don't know what imagination is anymore, because everything is ready-made . " In former days children only got a box of building blocks, and they were able to make whole cities out of it, but then came Lego, which made it easier, and now you can buy complete prebuilt toy houses and cars", older people say. Is this true ? Yes, it is. Does it mean that children's imagination is not stimulated anymore ? No, it doesn't. Children simply use their ingenuity in other fields. Instead of thinking about how to build a house, they will invent stories of people living in the houses. Give a six-year-old a game to play on the computer, and he will find out how to play it faster than any adult. Children's creativity and skill are not gone, they have simply shifted to another field .
Today's world is ruled by technology, science and industry. Sometimes it seems these let no room for dreams and imagination, but if you look closer, these important parts of human life are still there, only in another form than before the age of television and computers .
