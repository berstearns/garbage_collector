Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
The feminist movement, the one we know today, began sometime in the 1960s, with women demanding their rights to jobs, political power, abortion and over all, the right to decide for themselves. They wanted to take women "out of the kitchens and nurseries", to the fields of life where they could make an impact. The feminists were regarded with suspicion by the general public, and disliked for their pushy way of doing things (demonstrations etc.) They were "not feminine", but still made themselves known as the feminists .
The feminists began a wave of sexual liberation and gave women a different status in society. What good there came out of it was that women lended their skills, talents, and intelligence to a world that much needed it, and the picture of women being stupid and uncapable of thinking was removed quite successfully. But on the way, lots of things were done wrongly. The view of the feminists as being slightly masculine, wearing trousers and heavy boots, changed radically in the eighties. Madonna and Cher came along as representatives for the "new" feminism - mini skirts and net stockings were the new power tools for these daring and outspoken women that no one stepped on who would not ruefully regret it later. The new prototype was that of an independent woman with her own career, with (or preferable without) children, with lots of affairs, (AIDS changed the trend in the mid-eighties) with lots of money and with lots of "go" in her. And of course she had to be stunningly beautiful and sexy, using all her wiles to get what she wanted, balancing successfully upon her black stiletto heels. This is largely the picture that has remained until this day .
I really believe feminism has done more wrong than good to the women in our society. Equality is a good thing, as far as one can take it without intruding on the identity of the men. Women have had, and still have, a tremendous workload that can seem really unfair at times, and the men clearly need to realise that their help is needed in household chores, in raising the children etc. What I feel has gone wrong is that the "new territory" we have gained has left some of us worse off than before. Lots of unhappy children have left in the wake of working parents, lots of men have left their homes when they felt no longer needed, and many women have suffered stress and burn-outs without understanding why. Another thing I think is wrong is that the feminists have wanted to make feminists out of every woman. Those who chose not to work, chose to be home with the children, were regarded with contempt. Housewives are "suppressed", "slaves to the men", "have no will of their own". Though one of the aims of feminism seems to be "liberation of the true self" everyone had to be liberated the same way, otherwise it was not acceptable .
Feminism has gone too far. The extremists use abortion as a contraceptive as acceptable as the Pill, and concepts of what is right and wrong is blurred by the vision of self-realisation at any cost. The new feminists are in many cases traitors of "true" feminism. The way to gain respect and equality is seldom to step on someone else, in this case the men and anyone else opposing the cause. That is, in my opinion, feminism today, and I am not exactly proud of it .
