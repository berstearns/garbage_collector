Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
 [Quotation] . This is how a song by Abba starts. It was popular in the 70's and it is still somewhat played, but it could as well have been written in the 90's. For many rich people - and especially for them - money means everything .
It is really amazing how greedy rich people can become. Regarding how much money they already have, they have no qualified reason to want more. They have more money than they ever can spend. I quote Quintus Horatius Flaccus, because I think this quote fits perfectly in this connection: [Quotation] . At the same time homeless people try to find a shelter for the night and some leftover food from the garbage, so that they wouldn't starve to death. The contrast is so big that you can't even fully understand it. The life of the rich people is something that the poor and homeless only can dream of. However, the rich don't even know how many homeless there are and if they know, they don't care. They are only interested in themselves and their money and property. These are of course heavy generalisations, but unfortunately the truth about many wealthy people. Then there is this other group of rich people. In order to have a good image, they pretend that they really care. They donate great amounts of money to charity and suddenly they are great heroes. Of course their money is very welcome, but in fact they are nothing else but hypocrites. Frankly, I don't know which is worse. Not to care at all or to be a hypocrite .
Of course it's natural that we need money in order to survive. Everything costs, nothing is free. But despite that money doesn't have to be the most important factor in one's life. I think the happiest people are those who have enough money, so they can live a normal life. In my opinion that's the way it also should be. And even if we self think that we have a little money, we always have more than the starving people in Bosnia or Africa. A couple marks from our wallet don't matter, but a couple marks for a starving child can mean everything .
Finland has just gone through a heavy recession and we've slowly started to recover from it. You have to cut a little here and there and raise taxes and other payments. I don't think that the politicians really understand what it means to wonder how to pay the rent and get the money to the food and necessary clothes. Their salary is secured, so they don't have to worry about such things. For them money is self-evident. There are nearly half a million unemployed people in Finland at the moment. They have to manage somehow on the dole, which is nothing to cheer at. Last summer I worked at a bank. There you have to deal with big sums of money - other people's money, so your attitude towards the value of money changes. You kind of begin to respect the money in a different way than before .
Even though money can be a powerful weapon, there are things which can't be bought and which shouldn't be bought. You can't measure love, health, family or friends in money. They are all above the value of money .
