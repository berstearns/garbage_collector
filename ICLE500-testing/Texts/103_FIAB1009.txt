Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is said to be the root of all evil. I agree, and I would like to add religion to that statement as well, but I will not. Money has become the centre of life to most people, perhaps it has always been that way. We have a tendency to make a distinction of rank, on the basis of how much money a person has. If a person is poor, he is considered to be a failure and lazy, but if he is rich, we admire that person because he has succeeded in life .
Happiness is measured in money. Not at all, says the rich man, but who would listen to him. He has never had to cope without it. Instead of trying to think about what would really give us satisfaction in life, most people have their aim set at making as much money as they can .
Let us have a look at what problems money has caused. First of all we have the developing countries that have been caught in a vicious cirkle. Many of the developing countries have been exploited by colonial powers. Instead of using the little arable land they have for growing food for their own people, they are growing coffeeplants, or the land is needed for cattle, those products are sold to industrial countries who are able to pay a very low price. For that little money the developing countries have to buy expensive food from the industrial countries, since they can not grow it themselves. Unless a developing country has a great natural resource, like oil or precious metals, it will be very difficult for it to get out of the cirkle .
If a developing country would, for instance find oil, it would not take long before it was dragged into war by its neighbour countries, and then of course the U.S.A would have to interfere, after all, we are talking about the black gold. People in developing countries are not able to get a good education, that would help them get away from the poverty .
The easiest and fastest way to make money is by becoming a criminal. Start dealing drugs, so what if it ruins peoples lives or kills them you will be rich. In order for the drugaddicts to get their money for drugs, they have to start committing crimes, and the cirkle is once again closing .
Does anybody know how much of our environment we have destroyed for a small profit? The development of car and heating fuels that are more harmless to the environment is slowed down by the big oilcompanies. Trees are made into paper, because we do not want to pay a bit more for recycled paper. How many people have been blackmailed, kidnapped or murdered this week, nobody knows. How many streetkids in Southamerica have been killed for their organs or had their eyes removed. These organs are sold on the blackmarket to the U.S.A. Makes one sick, does it not .
The russian mafia is crawling into Finland, are we able to stop it .
It is clear that money is the root of all evil, but there is nothing we can do about it. I have decided to become a teacher, because I enjoy working with people, and after the time as a poor student, ever a teacher's pay will be like a fortune .
