Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
The television is a rather new invention, but the fact is that it is rather difficult today to find a home that has no TV. Very quickly the television has won the hearts of the people, and many people are now so used to it that they could not even think about a life without it. The television has become an important part of out lives; both as an informant and as an entertainer, depending on which role we give it .
In some families the television has become the centre of the family. The only time when the members of the family are together is when they are watching TV. I think this is a very sad situation. People are afraid of discussing with each other because they are not used to discuss. It is sad when the children can't talk with their parents anymore. They could naturally talk with their friends, but when they are together with their friends they are also watching TV. Then they don't need to say so much; the television is talking for them .
For people who always are alone the television can become the only friend. It might be their only social connection to other people. They are not necessarily watching TV, but they keep the TV on to fill the room with voices. It is almost like someone was talking and they don't have to feel so lonely. The television can't replace another human being, but it can give a certain feeling of safety .
Some people use the television as a babysitter. It is easy to place a child in front of the TV, where it mostly is sitting still since the moving pictures are fascinating it. This could be very dangerous. The TV is full of terrifying pictures that would frighten a child. I think a child may watch programmes for children, but it should always be together with a grown-up person, who is keeping an eye on the child and the TV.
The best quality of the television is that it is a great intermediary of information. I would not say that the TV gives objective information because somebody is always choosing the pictures that the TV shows. But the watcher gets at least a chance to see an event with his or her own eyes and can interpret it as he or she likes. The problem is that people tend to believe everything they see on television. They think everything that is said in the news, for example, is true. This means that the television gets a great power. Because of this naivet√© of the people violent movies can have a devastating effect. People in the movies can take punches, no matter how hard they are, and people may think it reflects reality. I think a lot of the violence in real life comes from the fact that people believe too much in what they see on television .
People are using the television in different ways; some are giving it a greater importance than others. I would say that people who assert that we are dependent on the television are not totally wrong. The television is very important for most of us. Nevertheless, I don't think it is so bad, as long as we remember that our relationships to other people are much more important than the television .
