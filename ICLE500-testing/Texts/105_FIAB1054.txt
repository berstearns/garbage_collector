Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
If Karl Marx were alive today, he probably would call television the opium of the masses. There are very good reasons for this, reasons that the average ' tube consumer ' would perhaps not think about. And the reason for not thinking lies in the medium: the television .
There is perhaps no other ethermedium today that is so effective a tool for manipulation of the human mind than is television. At least this is true in the Western world, where watching television is, most likely, the most popular form of leisure activity. The reasons for the popularity of television can in my opinion be sought in the simple fact that man is lazy above all other things. Man does not want to trouble his brain more than necessary. The television also satifies one of man's basic needs: his curiosity. Television is an excellent way of taking a peek at what other people are doing, and how. In the programmes that run on from night to night, the viewer can identify with the people and the lifestyles that he is offered, or, he can look down on what he sees and gain certain pleasure also from his negative feelings. It is no wonder that the tube is interesting. Because of this interest, somebody who wants to use television for propaganda purposes can be sure that he always has an audience, willing to take in whatever is on the menu .
Marx would probably see the TV as the ultimate capitalist monster, at least when looking at the United States, where more money is spent on the medium than anywhere else. He would be very right, in the way that the capital really controls the medium and the messages that it relays to the masses. Air time costs a great deal of money, so it does not take much to come to the conclusion that the upper layers of society can control the airways. Television is also the tool of the market. An audiovisual advertisement is very effective, and the people working for the media industry know how to make one. It is of course true of all types of programmes that they have to be well made in order to get through with the desired impact, so certain demands are put on the machinery producing the programmes. If there is no extensive private media market, the broadcasting is usually a state enterprise. This is of course a danger in the way that it is very easy for the government to exercise censure .
There are also numerous positive aspects of television. It is a good medium of education, and a great carrier of important world events. The satellite era has brought almost unlimited possibilities with it. Unfortunately, it again a question of money. The television is an expensive medium, compared with for example the radio. The equipment that is needed is very costly for the broadcaster, not least because a huge transmitter network has to be built in order to reach out to the audience. The reason for this is the characteristics of the frequencies that are used. A TV receiver is also expensive compared with a radio, and because of this it is not suited for education projects et.c. in developing countries, where it really would fill an important function. On the other hand, it is quite evident that all the negative features of television would follow the positive .
If Marx would hold television as the opium of the 20th century, I would agree with him. The tube makes passive people who become more and more easy to manipulate as they carry on watching. But although I personally see television as something mainly negative, I would like to get the chance to remind mr. Marx that opium is used as a tranquilizer against pain. Maybe TV has a calming effect on its audience in these rough (?) times. At least we might be able to forget what kind of damage watching television does to us .
