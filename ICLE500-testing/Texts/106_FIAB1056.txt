Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Technology and science are part of everyday life. As I wake up in the morning I am surrounded by strange things which have become self evident for me during the years. Only by pressing one button that colourful box on my desk pours out sounds and voices of people who I do not personally know. The same is happening with that one size bigger box standing on my table. There are persons staring at me from a screen, talking to me, telling me, in the same time, how brutal and sweet the world is that I am living in. In the next minute I'll get advice on how to make chocolate mousse or how to cook potatoes filled with mushroom cream. Suddenly I am surrounded by strangers. Is my imagination playing a trick on me? Am I dreaming or is this reality?
Dreaming and imagination in the modern world is a personal matter. No one can force you into dreaming or experiencing the wonderful or brutal world of imagination, or was it the world of reality? What you adapt from your surroundings is what you will experience. Reality, dreams and imagination are strongly connected with each other, they walk hand in hand in your mind. It will be your choice to pick out the one which you want to become a part of. Together with the world of dreams and imagination you will not be alone. Something or someone is always following you wherever you go. Memories are part of the world of dreaming. These memories have once been part of the world of reality. Your brains could be seen as a high technological computer which is able to select exactly the things which you want to bring up. But in order to find the right file in your brains you will need the right kind of stimuli. Personally, I'll only need the scent of a creamy cappuccino in order to open the "file" in my brains called "The Summer of 1994". Suddenly that "file" with its memories become real for me again. I have been given the opportunity to experience one summer that has already passed once more. And I know that I am lucky because I can open that special "file" whenever I want to for the rest of my life. Only the key needed for opening the file could change during the years - the key does not have to be that abstract one with the scent of a cappuccino but a concrete photo. However; what is important is the fact that I do not need help from science or high technological tools in order to dream and imagine in our modern world of today. But, on the other hand, I am able to receive help and some handy hints from the technological world of today as well...
Do you still remember those screaming boxes which I was talking about earlier? They are actually called radio (the smaller one) and television (the one with the screen). They represent very concrete examples of tools which, in my opinion, are used in order to understand the technological and industrialized world of today. They can themselves be seen as examples of high tech, of development, of future and hope. Still, they give you an opportunity to dream and imagine. For instance, I only have to watch those beautiful Alpin landscapes which appear on the screen of my television in order to escape to another world - to a world of imagination. This technological tool gives me an opportunity, a choice - and only I can decide if I want to live in this, somewhat rough, modern technological world or in the world of dreams and imagination...
