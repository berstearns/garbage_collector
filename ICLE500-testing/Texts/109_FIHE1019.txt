Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
Once in a while I have heard people argue that the university degrees are theoretical and take too much distance from the real world with its practicies. The degrees are of very little value as a whole .
At first sight the argument does make some sense: it is the easiest and most conventional view to have as far as universities, degrees, values or education on the academic branch are conserned. So, there is an opinion to point out even though people would know nothing about the realities of the subject matter. There is no one thing that would suggest another type of attitude towards the argument: people can simply answer "yes" or "no" - whether they agree or not. The title includes only few words that should be strong enough to show the real nature of things on this special branch of the educational life - a life, which is used to theorizing and evaluating more than holding on opinions .
On the basis of the title argument it might be right to expect academic studies lead to an end where graduates more clearly find themselves professionals to be, at least, instead of being fed up with theories and values that would never do anywhere. There is no easy way to point out in solving problemacy of the academic education. What would be relevant or what would count as important are matters to solve for those more acquainted with the academic conventions .
As for the title, one important point for me might be trying to realize the meaning of the two sentences in the title and take different views on them .
The title argues that most degrees are theoretical . "Most" suggests that "not all" degrees are theoretical. If the title is changed so that not all university degrees are theoretical to the extreme, there would be a different way to handle the subject as a whole. The same method can be used for the other arguments in the title what is the real world to prepare for like and which are the values that would make the academic degrees less important .
As to the value argument, it would also be necessary to find out, what those unimportant university degrees with minor values would be .
A university would not be a university without theories of a higher education and values of science: scientific thought and experimental practicies belong there. There are other institutions of the higher education with more practical forms of studying that prepare students for their working careers - if there will be any work to find in Finland or somewhere else .
Many basic university degrees prepare students for educational work at the different levels of the Finnish school system. University degrees contain theoretical parts on subjects for the undergraduates to study and the graduates, then, to teach after qualification. Subjects to get acquainted with demand plenty of time and work in several years: there is no easy way out of the university for an academic student who will come back to the real world qualified with a degree .
Leaving the university without a degree has been a real problem on branches of the higher education such as the Social Sciences and the Humanities .
Something is happening in the Finnish school - and educational system. Reforms are discussed throughout the educational system - also at the level of the higher education. Possibilities to study further are opened up for new groups of students and new, more practical, non-scientific forms of education preparing for professions and deepening knowledge on more practical branches have been started in recent years. Maybe this would make one real answer to the argument of the educational values as to the university degrees and the real world the students should live in .
