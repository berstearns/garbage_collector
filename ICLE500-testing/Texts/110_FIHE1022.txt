Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
This is a claim that is often being made, especially by people who criticize the university system. I agree that university degrees are theoretical, but I think that it does not necessarily mean that they would be of little value in real life. Quite the contrary. I would like to argue that the concentration of theory is actually very useful and valuable, both for the individual and the society in general .
The way I see it, the less theoretical education, say, for example, vocational education, is no more successful in preparing students for "the real life" than the more theoretical university education is. The vocational training typically tells the student exactly what to do and how. It gives ready made solutions to problems, so the student who has completed vocational education has not usually learned how to deal with unexpected problems or situations. And as we know things seldom work out the way one expects, and we often find ourselves facing an unexpected problem. The university education, on the other hand, prepares students especially for these unexpected situations. University education encourages students to personal interpretation of situations and individual problem solving. It familiarizes students with different methods and theories, different perspectives and ways of solving problems. It demands the students to be more independent and requires more creativity from the students themselves, than the less theoretical education, and I see these abilities as very important in the real life .
The claim often goes that the vocational education is much better because it prepares students for their specific professions. Some things a university degree might not be able to give us. These might include such routine skills as correct telephone conduct, or how to repair a copy machine, that are needed in most jobs today. Instead of these mechanical skills the university education gives us something much more useful; it enhances our mental capacities and develops our creative problem solving abilities. And is thus, in my opinion, much more useful in the long run. When talking about employment we must also take into consideration the fact university degree is usually a requirement for the top posts, in which case university education is very useful indeed .
In addition to the benefits that university education has in securing high level employment, we must also look at its value to the individual in his private life. The university teaches us to understand various spectra of life more fully, whereas vocational education seldom has opportunities for this. The Finnish university degree in particular gives us both all-round education, and a deeper and more detailed understanding of one or two fields. When we study at university level we learn the know-how of collecting information, processing and analysing it. We learn how to theorize, and how to perceive larger structures behind the fractured information that is being poured to us. We are able to examine information critically, to question things and not accept them at face value. A person who has gone through the vocational education system does not have these tools at his use. Therefore he may sometimes feel that he the real life does not make any sense to him, and feelings of alienation might result from this .
A further example of how university education prepares us for the real life, and how it is beneficial, is the fact that educated people tend to be more active in the society, by belonging to different organisations and voting actively. Due to their educational background these individuals realise their potential of making their voice heard, and that they really can influence decision making in the society. So university education is actually very valuable from the society's point of view as well, and not merely from the individual's .
