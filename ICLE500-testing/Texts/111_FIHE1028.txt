Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
"How can gambling be wrong when you win this much?" This was the embarrassed comment of a British clergyman to the press after he had won Â£214.000 on pools. In his charmingly honest confusion, this priest actually gave a down-to-earth expression to a problem which troubles many people throughout the civilized world: Is money the cause of all evil? Should one, at any cost, try to avoid possessing more money than is needed for one's daily bread and monthly rent?
Indeed, it is often said that money is the root of all evil. In actual fact, however, this well-known phrase is a misquotation of the biblical verse in 1. Timothy 6:10 which calls the love of money the root of all evil. Regardless of what we think of the Christian Holy Scripture and its authority, most of us probably agree with the idea that money in itself is nothing but paper and metal; in other words, money as such is not a mysterious essence with a magic power of its own, but an instrument used and accepted in human beings' transactions for goods and services in most parts of the world. Money is merely a medium of exchange with the help of which we can purchase things in order to satisfy our needs and desires .
Hence, the crucial point is not money as such but our attitude towards it. This attitude, in turn, manifests itself, first, in the means which we are willing to use to get more money, and, secondly, in the ways in which we spend the money that we already have .
To simplify, one can say that there two kinds of ways to deal with money, namely, self-interested ways and disinterested ways. To make the matter a little more complicated, one might add that there are also different opinions as to which of these two courses is wiser to take. From the point of view of peace and balance in society, however, it seems readily apparent that it is reasonable, to say the least, to guarantee some kind of basic income for everyone. As the English writer Samuel Butler puts it: [Quotation] The question of self-interested and disinterested use of money is a tough one. In modern society, most us probably agree that everyone has the fundamental right to use their money to satisfy their basic needs. But even in the case of a statement as simple as this we run into difficulties. What are these "basic needs"? Food, clothes, accommodation and health care, certainly. But what kind of food? What kind of clothing? A flat or a house? A GP at a public health care centre or a specialized physician in a private hospital? And once we go beyond the word "basic", the difficulties become even greater. What can we buy for ourselves without going against our conscience, or against what should be our conscience? How much of our income are we supposed to give to charities - one percent, as the modern charity movement claims, or ten percent, as is commanded by the old Judaeo-Christian tradition?
There are no simple answers. We all must search for own solutions - and to be ready to modify them, when needed. In so doing, it is important to bear in mind that the responsibility for the decisions we make is ours alone. We cannot blame a faceless entity called "money" for the evil things which take place in our world. Money as such is neither good nor evil. It is us who use it for either good or evil ends .
