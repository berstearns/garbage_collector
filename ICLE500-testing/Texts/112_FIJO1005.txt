Title: Is capital punishment different in kind from other sorts of judicial sanction? If it were shown to be effective in deterring  crimes of certain sorts, would that justify its use? 
 
In Fedor Dostoyevski's novel "Crime and punishment" the main character, Razkolnikov, gets his punishment for the crime he has done in two different ways: before he turns himself in and gets senteced to prison, he gets a mental punishment, his own conscience is so bad, that he gets mentally ill .
Our culture, which is based on Christian religion, strongly believes in punishment. If the one, who has sinned, does not get his punishment in his earthly life, he will get it after his death. Justice will eventually be done. And justice is that the one, who is guilty, gets punished .
The society usually takes care of punishing criminals. The type and the degree of punishment depends on the crime that has been committed. What is considered as crime, and the degree of the crime depends on society. For example in China expressing an opinion might be so serious a crime, that it leads to a death sentence. In some states of the USA killing a person can lead to a death penalty: in Finland one can slaughter ten people, and get a "life sentence", which means twelve years of free accomodation on tax payers' expence .
In modern societies punishing criminals in various degrees is explained by society's obligation to protect its memebers. If one person threathens the life, peace, etc., and (especially) the capital of others, the society has an obligation to keep this person from harming the majority. Society either locks this person away for a while, to keep him from commiting more crimes, or puts him away permanently by executing him or sentencing him to prison for his life, or makes him pay in money for what he has done .
Punishment is also meant to be an example for other possible criminals. An executed murderer will certainly not go on killing innocent people, exept in horror movies, but he will not learn anything either. The alternative to death sentence is a life sentence, an imprisonment for the whole life, not for twelve years like in our country, and it costs money - tax payers' money - and if the criminal will not get out of the prison alive, what is the use of keeping him alive: he will never be a useful member of the society, anyway. In case of a massmurderer I would not believe that he would learn, and become a useful member of society ever: if a person is a massmurderer, there is certainly something wrong in his mind. In my opinion, the society has no obligation to keep this kind of a nuisance alive .
By setting an example to the society by punishing the criminals, the state administers are doing the same what parents are doing, when they punish their children: teaching. Parents, in principal, punish their children in order to teach them so, that they will be able to manage in the society when they grow up. They are punished (in theory) when they do something that could harm them or the others. For a while ago I read in the newspaper, that a young boy had been heard to explain that if the alarmsticker is torn out from a toy in a shop, it is easier to carry the toy out of the shop, i.e. to steal it. The policeman who was interviewed here said that it sounded like the boy's parents had taught him that. This policeman suspected, and I am afraid that he might be right, that parents do not teach their children properly, what is right and wrong. Also they do not set a good examples for their children. But neither does the society to its members .
Using death penalty as an example to threaten possible criminals, the society is also sort of legalizing murder. If the society has the right to kill people, why would not an individual person have the same right?
No one can say, which punishment is justified. Which punishment is most suitable for a certain crime? What is a crime? Not one of the punishing systems that I know can guarantee an equal and fair punishment. Not one system can guarantee, that the person punished in some cases is actually the one who is guilty. There are many cases, which are not solved - and the criminal walks out. Also, it seems to me, the law is sometimes so complicated, that even if the person is proved guilty, he may get without a punishment .
The only really fair system of punishments seems to be the "eye for an eye"-system. At least the punishment, when given, is fair. Of course, findind the guilty remains to be a problem. Our society, as based on Christian religion, has taught its members to "turn the other cheek", and that is why we find this kind of punishing system cruel - it feels like a revenge .
