Title: Is capital punishment different in kind from other sorts of judicial sanction? If it were shown to be effective in deterring  crimes of certain sorts, would that justify its use? 
 
Finnish law employes different punishments for people of various ages. I will focus on punishments for young criminals in my essay .
According to Finnish law people under 21 years old of age are considered to be young offenders. They have always some sort of a special position when punishments are being ordered. They are divided further in three different groups: people under 15, 15-17 and 18-20 years old of age. The penal scale in these cases is very wide which is one reason for making it so unclear. It is not always perfectly clear which is the proper punishment in every case. There are three different alternativies that can be employed in young offender cases: do nothing, custidy measures or punishments .
In most cases the punishment is a conditional sentence. People under 18 years of age can not even be sentenced to unconditional imprisonment unless it is a matter of a very serious crime with heavy reasons. This has a purpose: conditional sentence is used to avoid the vicious circle of crimes and institutions, which often happens to a young person who has to go to prison .
I think there are also many problems with conditional sentence. The young people who get it consider it often as a liberating sentence, because there is no need to go to prison. Another problem facing conditional sentence is the accumulation of sentences. If a young person gets many conditional sentences they lead to a very long imprisonment time once executed .
Children under 15 years old of age can not be delivered any kind of a sentence. Only measures regarding child welfare can be used. Older criminals take of course advantage of this. They have their crimes committed by younger ones who can not be thrown into jail. This is obviously one reason why crime among children under 15 years old has increased considerably recently. It might help if the age limit was lowered or the court could exercise discretion in each case .
If the court is given full free discretionary power it may cause unsecurity among people about their legal rights. People would no longer know what punishment they would get if they commit a crime. It would be also questionable whether punishment would be equally applied to all. If the court does not have clear regulations two persons committing the same crime could get two totally different punishments. The court might simply find the the other offender more pleasant or he/she could have the public's opinion on his side or he/she could be judges relative and so on .
It is easy to critisize regulations on punishments, but if there were not any, if the court had full free discretionary power, it would be even worse. Punishments could not be equally applied to all .
