Title: Is capital punishment different in kind from other sorts of judicial sanction? If it were shown to be effective in deterring  crimes of certain sorts, would that justify its use? 
 
Why have we invented punishments? What do we want to accomplish or prove by using them? These are rather simple questions to answer but they tend to become more complex when we think of fairness and equality in relation to punishments .
There are acts and violations of human rights that can not go unpunished. For instance, such an extreme crime as murder could not just be forgotten and the murderer left free. For the good of individual people criminals should be isolated from society if they can not behave according to common rules. But who is criminal? On what grounds do we judge that someone has broken the rules? According to dictionaries a criminal is someone who has committed an illegal action, that is broken the law society has legislated through government. The next question that comes up is how should we punish the criminals. And furthermore what would be the right punishment for each crime? Can we make generalisations or do we have to judge each case individually? Yes and no. Yes, we can say that certain crimes such as steeling or damaging someones property, where only material things are concerned, are minor crimes and the offenders can usually be punished according to the same pattern. No, in that sense that in more serious cases such as murder, where people are concerned, we need to think of the criminals as individuals with differences in behaviour, background, values and motives. We can not judge them all on grounds of one or two cases because that would be like saying we are all alike. In general the conclusion is that the punishment should be equivalent to the seriousness of the crime. So if a criminal has committed a murder he or she will have to get a more severe punishment than someone who has caused only material damage which can be compensated with money. At least according to Western values .
The next question we have to answer is what we want to show or prove by using punishments. The usual answer is that they have been invented to show that crime does not pay. Furthermore their purpose is to make us aware that certain things are not allowed in society and those who violate the rules will be punished. But they can also prevent crimes from happening because if we know enough of the circumstances under which a crime has been committed we learn to avoid those situations and more importantly solve them in a peaceful way. The function of punishment is also to show that crimes are not acceptable or that they can solve any problems. On the other hand the aim of punishments is to make the criminals obey the laws and show example to other's so that they will not follow the bad example and commit the same crime .
But what about the fairness question then? Let us consider a situation were a known athlete and an ordinary man both commit the same crime. Will they be punished in the same way and according to the same paragraph of law? Probably not. Since the jury consists of men and women, real people with opinions and prejudgements of things, they can not put their feelings aside and be objective knowing that the other accused is a celebrity of whom they have already formed an impression. On one hand our value system, background, upbringing all influence our decisions. On the other hand not even the legal system treats everyone the same. Those who have money are able to hire a high-paid lawyer who can perform better than those public defenders who have to struggle with overtime problems. This means that our equality in front of the law is dependent on our financial state. Furthermore there are also other factors that contribute to the inequality in the court of law. For instance if a particular case gets a lot of publicity the people concerned handling it, especially the judge, might be pressured into ruling according to public demands and in the same time neglecting individuals rights to fair trial. More importantly punishing someone should never cross the line of revenge because then it could never be applied fairly .
Thinking of the right punishment we should keep in mind that the criminals are also human beings and they should be given the chance to correct their errors and readjust into society if possible. Should not we be greatful even if one lost sheep could be reunited with the herd?
