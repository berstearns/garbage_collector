Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This is not the case; we can see results of people's imagination everywhere around us, and some of them, like the car or the telephone or the aphabet or the zipper are extremely important to us. The use of imagination is as necessary in scientific work as in creating art and it is also needed in everyday life .
Without imagination the world would stop since there would be no development or reforms. If people would not always have dreamt of a better world or an easier living there would not be all that highly developed science and technology today. Naturally dreams alone would not take us very far unless we are willing to take steps towards realizing them .
However, imagination is important for us not only because we can use it to create new revolutionary theories or something more concrete but also because we can pass time and forget our worries for a while by daydreaming. Without that possibility for escape life could sometimes be unbearable .
The appreciation for imagination in our modern world can be seen most clearly in art. Every year representatives of different art forms are given well known awards like Oscars or the Nobel prize for literature. And the gigantic movie industry is a dream land in itself: it creates dreams for us. We do not need to dream ourselves if we do not want to and if we do, we are told what we should be dreaming of .
Money, love, sex, adventure - in the films we see the same elements that are present in most of our dreams. The heroes and heroines live in a world of many possibilities and happy coincidences. We can put ourselves in their position and there it is: a perfectly good dream in flashy colours without much effort. Millions of people share the same dreams of prehistoric adventures in Jurassic Park or of love that conquers all in some faraway country where they do not know words like poverty and depression .
Movies and ads show us what to dream of today and tomorrow and what we could do (wear, eat, drink, listen to) to make those dreams come true. There are numbers of people who even make their living out of dreams; models, beauty queens, actors, writers and advertising artists, to mention some of them. And many people do not notice that they are living their lives in somebody else's dream .
In our dreams we reach for the stars and luckily there are people who are capable of making their, or other people's wildest dreams come true. Imagination is an inborn part of us and no matter how far science and technology will develop it will remain an important factor in our world until humans have been replaced by a more rational life form and there are different ways of making progress .
