Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
"Did you watch the Bold and the Beautiful yesterday?" That is a very common question in today's Finland. You see, the Bold and the Beautiful is a very popular soap-opera - maybe even the most popular ever - in Finland. This is also a good example of how a conversation can be opened nowadays. Previously when people were strangers to each other or for some other reason did not know what to say, they started to talk about some very "neutral" things, for example the wheather. Now people more often talk about TV programmes, maybe because you actually cannot have an interesting conversation about the wheather and because everybody has at least some sort of opinionabout TV programmes. I personally have noticed that you can have serious discussions on a basis of a harmless TV show. Well, actually I have experienced one exception to this rule. It was when I met a person whose religion prohibits the watching of television. I did not know that and I asked him if he had seen some movie on TV the night before. Then he explained the situation to me and for some reason there was not an enthusiastic conversation but an awkward quietness which followed .
If we think about the effect which TV has on our lives more seriously, we have to admit that TV provides us with much more than just entertainment. Without TV we wouldn't know so much about other countries' affairs and the events of the world. Of course we would still have newspapers but to very many people TV is the most common way to get information. It's probably because it is much easier and quicker to watch the news from television than to read a newspaper. Of course it has to be admitted that - for various reasons - the news is not always compeletely objective or truthful. I'm not suggesting that news agencies are unreliable, but it is obvious that all events can't be fitted in the ten o'clock news and so it has to be chosen what to tell and what to leave out. And there are always several ways of telling things. By emphasizing some facts and ignoring others, people can get very different views about things. I don't consider it as dishonesty, but it is inevitable every time when information is being transferred .
So TV offers us "light" entertainment meaning soap-operas and things like that, information with the form of the news but in my opinion TV also gives us a lot of general knowledge about various things. I mean by that that it is assumed that you for instance know who Jack Nicholson is and that you know what kind of music Gun's'Roses plays, because you have seen them on MTV. Television and it's stars have rooted into our society and they have become so familiar to us that we may even say that we couldn't live without TV or wonder how people have been able to spend time without TV. To put it in a simple way: we just can't imagine our evenings without TV and it's loud noice. And I guess that most of us didn't even want to; we just are used to sitting in our sofas and watching some indifferent programmes we may not even like very much. But if somebody would try to break that habit, we would not know what else to do. We are a TV generation and we don't know other kind of life. Maybe we should start to learn or otherwise our children will depend on TV even more than we do .
