Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
 [Quotation] ... and ABBA was right, they literally hit the nail on the head. Money is important, money is power. Of course there are some other things that are even more important, such as love or a true friendship, but I am sure everybody agrees that money definitely belongs to the most valuable things in peoples' lives. It is true, yes, money can cause also negative effects, for example greediness or jealousy but its' positive effects are much more powerful. Money talks, money is the key that fits in every door. When you have money you can do what ever you have dreamed about. You do not have to count every penny any longer, thinking whether you can or cannot afford your plans. Money gives you a possibility of a fuller and more secure life. In my opinion, money is not by any means the root of all evil - oh no, it is quite the opposite .
When I still lived at home with my parents I never had any bigger problems with money. Food and living did not cost me anything, there were no bills for me to pay and I even got a little pocket money. It never ocurred to me how expensive it was to take care of only those most essential parts of living. I never realized that someday I am alone and counting every penny in order to survive. For four years now I have been on my own. At the age of 19 I left home and moved in together with my boyfriend. We are both students and the financial situation is not very good. But we will survive; thanks to our parents who are kind people and concerned about us. They give us some extra money every now and then when we have it tough. They are a great help to us and I wish that someday we could pay them back for what they have done to us. Even though we, my boyfriend and I, are already of age, they still want to help us. That is something one cannot forget .
We have tried everything so that we would not need to ask money from our parents - it is really embarrassing to beg for alms all the time. We have played Lotto and bought even some lottery tickets (how desperate!) but we have not ever, not even once, won anything... Perhaps we just were not born under a lucky star. We do not work because there are no jobs available, the taxes are too high and there is no time because of the studies. Sometimes I have caught myself dreaming about someday being rich, wondering what I could do if I had so much money I could do whatever I wanted. Well, I would buy beautiful clothes, a nice house with pane windows and three collie-dogs, one of each colour... I would travel in various countries and enjoy life. Is that too much asked? I would love a life without constant worries about money and especially the lack of it. When I finally wake up from my dreams I suddenly realize that that "someday" of my dreams is not here yet. Today is today and I am still a poor student .
But I will go on living and trusting in the future. I will study hard and finally somehow deserve my well-being. To be a student is not easy for anybody in today's Finland. Financial aid given for the students is not much and it is horrible to take a loan in these days. The future is unsecure and frightening because the unemployment rates have been raising all the way through under the past few years. But we cannot give up - I am definitely not going to give up. Instead I am going to get myself a proper profession and to get along... maybe even be rich! These years of counting pennies have given me strenght and willpower to fight for certain goals and to prove myself that hard work and strong will, if nothing else, can make my life better and bring well-being and riches - and of course a possibility to have my three beautiful collie-dogs...
