Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Thousands of years ago there was an ancient man who needed something he could not get or gain alone. So he went searching, searching for another man who could possibly have that something. When he finally found him, it appeared that this particular man missed something, too, something that the first man had more than he needed. That was an evident bargain. They changed, they bartered, and both could now have all the things they needed to survive .
That is how bartering possibly may have begun. Somewhere, someone had got something; and somewhere else, a few miles away, someone else had got something else . "You take a sackful of this if I can have a sackful of that." And the both agreed. The first problem those ancient men probably faced was: "What about if what I have and the other fellow needs is scantier and more valuable, far rarer than the stuff the other fellow has and I need? I should definitely have more, maybe double the amount than the other fellow. I take two sackfuls of your thing, you will only get one sackful of mine."
Sometimes it was easy and fair. Both agreed and were happy. But sooner or later they faced difficulties. They must have disagreed on the bartering conditions at some point. And then they had to invent a tool, a means of trading. First the means might have been skins of animals, then valuable metals like gold, then special pieces of gold which later developed to round coins, then paper with different symbols indicating its value and, finally, data signals controlled by plastic cards and computer systems .
Definitely the development of trading means has made trading a great deal easier. But what else has the introduction of money brought with it? From the very beginning, when it was determined and commonly adopted that silver and gold would be of value and a measure of richness, there have been people who have gathered them and become devoted to gathering them. And then the ever-growing passion for wealth spread along with the growing civilization and began to touch every corner of the world. And no good can be expected when money becomes a drug, an obsession, where always more and more has to be gained. Life becomes easier, but only materially easier when one has got a lot of money. One does not have to care about his subsistence or survival. Who would not like to lead an easy life without serious material concern?
And man, in his greed, was very cunning, too. He created a ruling and controlling system; he created a pecking order where the richest men control those who are not as rich while they together master "average folk" who, joining the richer ones, control together poor people who still have the opportunity to trample on even poorer people - the poorest of all. Those who are rich have got the power to master and make decisions and, after all, they get more wealth. More wealth brings more power, more power brings even more wealth, and so on. The continuing vicious circle (vicious to the poor and the idealists only) is ready. The table is set, the money meal is served for the rich. The oppression may begin .
This principle of the connection between money and power has been applied successfully many times during the history of mankind. A good example is the colonialism of European countries in the last centuries. Already more civilized, industrialized and technically developed Europeans who had moderately high standard of living, had got the power and could easily conquer land in Africa and South America. There people used to lead a simple life and could not resist. Soon were the whole two continents divided between conquerers. The result was that the rich got more and the poor were left with even less that they used to have .
This story can be told again and again and it happens all the time in different disguises. Greed for money has been the source of many bad acts and the reason for many sad things that have happened. But so have power, might, war, organized religion and many other kinds of addictions as well. And none of them shows itself alone : all are connected in a way. And every coin has the other side, too .
