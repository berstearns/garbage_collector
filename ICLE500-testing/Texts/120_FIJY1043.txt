Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
When people think about feminism, they usually consider it as an ideology based on the thought about the cause of women. But what exactly does the term cause of women mean? Is it the principle of ordinary women striving for the equality of the sexes or that of ardent feminists who would like to dominate the whole world and men? It is definitely not easy to answer this question, because there are various opinious about what the cause of women really is. It seems that also the word feminism has many meanings in our society. The original meaning probably is the one that defines feminism as an activity aiming at equal rights and chances for men and women. However, the complexity of those two concepts often leads to misunderstandings .
On second thoughts, it is true that when you hear or see the word feminism, you immediately know that it has something to do with the female sex. This is a simple fact known to everybody, but has anyone ever wondered why this movement striving for equality has a name that totally excludes the opposite sex? A man can't be a feminist. The movement is not called the equality movement but the feminist movement, for women only. Thus, the name divides people into male and female. That is why it is often thought that the whole ideology is against men, which means that it can't be for equality. Feminists are regarded as women having a dislike of men, which on no account is a good thing for their reputation .
It must be admitted that there is a natural division into men and women that we just have to accept. This physiological and, above all, psychological difference is purely positive - without it the relationships between men and women would be pretty boring... Our bodies are different, we think in slightly different ways, etc. Unfortunately, the fact that this difference exists has always made one of the sexes think that it is entitled to oppress and dominate the opposite one. In the history of the world men have usually been the dominators, for the simple reason that they are stronger. Though there are some primitive cultures led by women, they are only exceptions to the rule. Nowadays, the situation is changing. The change started in the 1960's and it has been a fast one. At that time, there was a sexual revolution going on in the western society. People no longer appreciated the old, conservative values that were full of references to religion. All that made it easier for the feminist movement to find support especially among young women. In a way, the emphasis was on sexuality, which affected the so-called feminist issues. Abortion became the hot issue. This changed the reputation of feminists. Earlier there had been demands for the right to vote, which had been attained. Women became militant and war broke out between the sexes. Feminists called each other sisters and some groups of women even lived together. Such intimacy made people consider them all as lesbians. Furthermore, those women started acting like men - burning their bras was a symbol of this change in their lifestyle. These were not the most brilliant feminist ideas, but they still influence the way people think. The characteristics of a feminist date back to 1960's: she is considered as an angry old maid who looks like a man .
Today, many women refuse to say they are feminists, because people have such negative attitudes towards them. Contrary to what might be thought, lots of women start to abandon this movement that should support women's rights. And yet they want equal pay, a right to education and work just like feminists. At the same time, the "real" feminists start to accuse those women of being stupid victims of men. There has to be something wrong with the whole movement. It has achieved lots of important goals that make women's situation better, but it also has had some harmful effects on the cause of women. The barrier between the sexes is still getting stronger even though people struggle for equality. Who is to blame? Men? Feminists? Non-feminists? Probably all of them. So why not try and solve our problems together without thinking so much about feminism, chauvinism or any other ideologies? It may be difficult, but it certainly is worth trying .
