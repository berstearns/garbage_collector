Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
"Money is the root of all evil" is an old saying, as well as "money does not make you happy". To some extent both of these arguments are true. Most people have always wished to be rich or are longing to have more money. Nobody seems to be happy with what they have already got .
Every week millions of people all over the world spend enormous amounts of money on betting, gambling, lotteries, Lotto and other games of chanche wishing to win a lot of money. But in fact more people have lost money on gambling than anyone has ever won .
This is one way of getting some excitement to your life. Many people enjoy thinking of what they would do, if they won. There is always the possibility to win, someone will sooner or later. It is quite all right to spend some money on Lotto and other games as far as it is not away from other more important needs .
There are many sad stories about gamblers, who have lost all their properties, when they have not been able to stop gambling in time. They have been overwhelmed by the urge to win. Gambling can turn into a sickness, which is difficult to be cured of. There are old pensioners who spend all their money on pinball and slot machines. There machines are thougt to be quite harmless but people can also get hooked to these .
To some people money and property have become so important that they are the main purposes in their lives. To use money and to enjoy the possibilities money could give are of no importance to them. They are like Uncle Scrooge, they just worry about their fortune and spend their time trying to get richer and richer. Rich people can also be really stingy. It gives them satisfaction if they manage to buy something cheep. On the other hand it can make them almost sick if they have to give out money .
Greed and jealousy have caused a lot of unhappiness. It is difficult to share your money or property with other people. Family members have turned to be enemies or have broken all contacts with each other because of quarrels about the inheritance .
There are also stories about Lotto winners whose lives have been distroyed because they have not been able to live a normal life after having got rich .
It is sure that richness or money alone do not bring happiness, but living in poverty does not make people better either. The fact that you have money makes your life easier. There will be many more opportunities in life if you have money. You are more free to make your own decissions. You will be able to educate your children, you can choose where to live and you have better possibilities to plan how to use your time .
Money does not have to be the root of all evil, it can give you your freedom and make your life easier. You just have to decide what you want to do and not let the money rule over you .
