Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value.

 [Quotation] 
Newspaper advertisements like these one can read almost in every newspaper or magazine. Why people with university degrees seek for job through newsadvertisements? There can be, of course many kinds of answers ranging from the point of view that university degrees are out of date to a conclusion that degrees are too theoretical not preparing students for the real life. One believes or has own experiences that degree does not answer the vocational demands .
When one thinks about the validity of the university degrees, one has to take into account many different needs: those of the society, science itself, post-graduate system, internationalization or to some extent student's own expectations. Today money plays the most important role in the field of (higher) education. It influences straight to the content of studies and the mode of courses. State funds had been greatly cut down in recent years and one sees no brighter future ahead. Cutting down the funds affect also on an ordinary student's daily studying life or style. The longitudity of studying has been limited to five years, the size of the groups is bigger, a lot of handouts to be read home(instead of workshops and interactive teaching - this does not mean that students are afraid of hard work). Savings jeopardize academic values and results .
It is clear that rapid changes in society, for example technological development, changes in working environment and greater need for international interaction demand a new way of thinking. One often hears many students to say: "Where an earth do I need this in real life?", "I do not know what to do with this course - it is pure theory." or "Oh, I am not going to enroll in this course. I think I do not understand a single word of it." Sometimes after a summer holiday one can hear students talking about their summer jobs . "I worked in this trading company, there were no use for my studies." or "Why do I study, becuse my studies did not help me at all in work!" It might seem that student's, university's and society's needs never meet each other. As one knows students are different kinds of people with different kinds of demands and everybody's demands can not be directly satisfied, although education is more and more based on individual choices despite of the savings .
One often forgets that everyday life's phenomena are mostly based on theories which come to life only with the touch of reality. According to my own experiences I do not agreee with the title that university degrees are too theoretical. All right, I have to admit that sometimes during my early university years I thought what an earth do I need this course for? But first stroke came when I was studying and working abroad. In everyday situations I noticed that I needed also theoretical knowledge. The more I learned, the more I needed theories to explain problems and give a solid foundation to things. And the most important thing which I realized was that the more I knew the more I was expected to know. Anyway theory/ies helped me to understand many language problems in practice and vise verca , in practical situations theory came to life and more understandable. Theories help to predict future and better to understand rapid changes. And therefore in my opinion university degrees are not too theoretical. I think that today's university degrees give a background and a fundament. And with the help of the degree everybody somehow manages in different working situations. Everybody has a possibility to deepen one's knowledge by oneself or apply, for example for post-graduate studies. Holly Carter has said somehow like this: "The two things parents have to give for their children are roots and wings." I think this holds true also for university studies .
