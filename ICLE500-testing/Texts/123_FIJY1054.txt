Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
The sound music of the american soap opera "The Bold and the Beautiful" starts and there is a quiet hour for otherwise so busy cashiers of the supermarkets. It's amazing how popular the series have become, not only in Finland but also in many other European countries .
The biggest part of the viewers of "The Bold and the Beautiful" consist of women: housewives, pensioners, "carrier women", teenagers, students, everybody watches it. Men as well, even though they don't easily admit it publicly. Some people even forbade their friends of calling them during their watching which has become a daily routine, others name their pets after the favourite characters .
"The Bold and the Beautiful" has obviously been made cheaply and not all the actors and actresses are particularly talented, which doesn't seem to worry the faithful audience at all. There are without doubt hundreds of series like that in the world and the question is what makes us watch such rubbish?
Everybody knows that the economical situation in Europe is bad. There are in Finland 500 000 unemployed people, the population being 5 million this is quite a figure. People feel uncertain and are worried about the future. Everybody needs dreams and TV provides a safe way to escape from reality .
There has been a lot of discussion and debates about television's effects on rising crime rates recently. It has been claimed that people adapt violent behaviour models from TV. I think this is not the whole truth; a normal person doesn't go out and start shooting passers-by after watching some action film unless he or she suffers from a serious mental disorder. TV alone can't be responsible for such behaviour .
No matter how controversial sosiologists', psychologists' and other experts' statements about televisions harmful influence on people and especially on children may be, there are only few among them who are not ready to admit that watching TV can also be extremely useful and educational. Language students for example, can greatly benefit from watching foreign films and programmes that international television channels broadcast. Television is the only one of the mass media that is able to transmit information in such a colourful and lively way. Not everybody can afford to travel around the world but through the agency of television we can dive in the oceans, take part in safaris in Africa, not to mention moon trips. During Olympic Games and other important sports events livingrooms often change into an auditorium, which may cause disagreement in many families...
Recently a famous french singer Patricia Kaas gave a concert in Helsinki. Many disappointed admirers didn't get a ticket and to comfort those who left outside the star sang a couple of songs in television .
What ever our opinion of television and the quality of programmes is, it is good to remember that the tiny button that enables us to choose what to watch and when to watch exists. The old truth that a machine is a good servant but a lousy master goes with a television too .
