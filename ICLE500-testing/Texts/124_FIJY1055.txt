Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is definitely the root of all evil. I believe that at least 96 % of all the people in the world are not satisfied with the amount of money that they possess. And because earning more money by honest work is too slow and the amount of money you get that way is too small, more and more people resort to dishonest action. But this is only one half of the story, for not only does the yearning for more money cause much physical harm, it also brings along great emotional pain .
Perhaps the most harmful thing about money is the fact that you can never have it enough. No matter how rich you already are, you will always want more, always. You can never just relax and enjoy your money. How sad and torturing it is to live your whole life always trying to reach the state where you no more have to worry about money, but never reaching it .
If you happen to be rich, you probably have one worry more than the poor ones; in the matter of friendship. How can you tell, who is your real friend and who is just some greedy slimeball after your money. As those slimeballs are usually excellent "actors", the only way to reveal their true colours would be to loose all your money. But because that is out of the question, you are stuck with uncertainty. So there is no one around you, who you could, without any doubt, trust .
The lust for money may in some cases also lead to passion for gambling. Las Vegas is the well-known paradise for gamblers all over the world. Many people have lost fortunes there, by the roulette tables. Some people even become addicted to gambling. They simply cannot stop gambling, even though they are up to their ears in debt because of it .
What about the drug business then. The drug lords have realized that you can get huge, gigantic profit in the drug business. And when the stakes are this high, all actions, including brutal murders, are "justified". The most horrible thing is that even some small kids are involved in this business. They are the best possible drug dealers, because no one usually suspects them, and because they cannot be arrested and imprisoned in case they get caught .
Too much money is definitely a bad thing especially for the young. They will never learn to work hard for something they want, if they can always get everything they want with money. For you can even "buy" someone to do your homework and your tests with enough money. This in turn can lead the young one to assume that everything is for sale, even friendship and love .
In some countries, even some policemen and judges are corrupted. With a few, carefully selected bribes, you can buy yourself out of trouble. So, money can even get in the way of justice .
The power of money scares me. I do not want it to get a hold of me. That is why I have decided to aim for managing with as small amount of money as possible .
