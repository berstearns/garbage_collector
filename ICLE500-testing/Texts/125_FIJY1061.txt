Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Dreams and imagination are powers that keep pushing us towards a new day. Dreams give us strenght and imagination makes our life more colourful and exciting. Some people say that in our technologized and industrialized world there is no room for dreams and imagination. imyself would like to think that these two things are such essential parts of human nature that they will stay as a prt of us whatever the world around us may be .
First of all, isn't it true that mostly all the technology and science we have today is a product of somebody's imagination. The dreams of moving faster and flying like a bird drove someone to invent the aeroplane. not only knowledge, but also imagination is needed in most of the new inventions. One could say that imagination is much more daring than scientifical knowledge. It can cross boundaries of knowledge and it constantly pushes the limits of reality further back. the technology needs both dreams and imagination .
In the middle of our world one can feel very lonely and sense hostility and agression in the society around us. I am sure that many people share the dream of a peaceful and quiet place surrounded by protecting nature somewhere that's green. many people would like to turn back time back to the times of a more natural way of living. All those things and many more are within everybody's reach via dreams .
Even though our world is much faster and somehow our life is more predictable than the one of our ancestors, we all stop to dream of something every now and then. Dreams are a thing no-one can take from us no matter how hard he tried. Of course some dreams get crushed along the way, but from the ashes of a dream rises another like the Phoenix. Dreams and imagination can be a way to escape from the wicked world or they can be used to make our life more exciting as it it here and now .
It is said that television and technological toys destroy a child's imagination, but when one watches children play one sees that the plot of the TV- serties is only the base stories and games are built on. The child only uses them as material. Quite often the ready made ideas and stories simply don't fit in the games at all. the mechanical toy has become a tool of the child's imagination .
It is true that some of our dreams strongly reflect our world as it is now. we dream of money, being slim and beautiful etc. the society we live in happens to be somewhat superficial and naturally so are many of our dreams. Money has a huge role in our life today. If one listens to people's dreams they are often of wealth. One wishes that one wouldn't have to worry about money all the time. During the financial depression many people have had to re-arrange their lives completely. With imagination and hope they have found new directions for their lives, lots of new things to do with their lives. The important values in life have been under a large change .
Dreams and imagination are an important oart of our lives. Without them we wouldn't have what we have now. With them we can head towards the future with great expectations of a better world .
