Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
I am a feminist; I just don't want to brag about it. The word ' feminist ' has many negative connotations, and anyone who claims to be one is immediately labelled as being hostile towards men in general. A stereotype of a feminist is a woman who is ready to take extreme action just to be noticed. She cuts her hair off, dresses in baggy clothes and never wears any make-up because she does not want to look feminine. She takes life very seriously, and spends most of her time feeling hurt or planning revenge because some selfsatisfied person has made a chauvinist remark again .
That is not how I see myself. And I believe that many women would say the same for themselves. At the next moment it is easy to deny the need for feminism, too. It is human: nobody wants to belong to a group of such unpleasant, maybe even frightening, people. However, very few would deny their need for equality .
The world is full of male chauvinism. It is easy to percieve that both in big and in small things even in Finland - a country famous for equality between men and women. Those jobs which are usually considered to be on women's domain are more poorly paid and less appreciated than those that men usually have. Someone has claimed that even universities are losing their value because of all the women studying and working there. A woman who wants to have a career is considered a bad mother if she has children. If she doesn't, she is less respected as a woman. The fellow workers of a man do not necessarily even know if he has children; his top priority is work, and that is taken for granted by everybody. In everyday life women are more often objects of sexual harrasment and belittlement than men. How many times does a man hear such a remark as ' You're cute when you get mad'?
So, it is obvious that feminism is absolutely necessary. However, some women refuse to have anything to do with it. They say that they don't need it. It is nonsense to claim that a single person could protect her social rights and fight for more appreciation of women. No one is strong enough to do that alone. It is as if a hungry person in some third world country said that he is the architect of his own fortune. The situation he is in is not his fault, neither can he solve the big problem ultimately by himself .
The extreme signs of feminism in the beginning of the movement, burning the bra for example, caused such a shock in the world that they have never been forgotten. They were signs of frustration, naive attempts to change the world, and, yet, the stereotype of a feminist is still based on them. But something had to be done then. Nowadays we must be grateful to those who were brave enough to start questioning the old truths. Maybe they didn't always know how to express themselves, and sometimes it became more important to scandalize the society than to work for equality between sexes. However, the consequense of all that was positive rather than negative .
Feminism does not have to be a feared phenomenon anymore. One does not have to be so privileged a person as before to be able to have and express opinions of social injustices. Even a shy person, like myself, or even a man can be a feminist. There is no contradiction in it if we all are fighting for a common cause: a more tolerant world .
