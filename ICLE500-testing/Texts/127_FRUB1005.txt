Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is the root of all evil This assertion may be false on the one hand because human beings need money to live on for some of us at least to survive .
Let us think to all the poor people in the world who desperately seek money to live at subsistence level, let us think to the third-world who asks the so-called industrialized and rich countries to help them in keeping alive their people. We must remember all the concerts organized to raise money and this to save people or countries from starvation .
There had been "USA for Africa", "Band Aid". So they stood up for starvation but also for many illness, notably AIDS or leukaemia or simply to save the world, let us remeber the concert to save the Amazonian forest .
On the other hand money perverts those who exaggerate, it is a kind of escalation iin the scale of possession, because for this kind of people possession rhymes with power and domination .
Let us give good and convincing examples of people perverted by money. Two or three days ago, a bank director robbed his own bank, he then left the country with his private secretary. why some famous ministers falsify their accounts, if not for money. Why do they risk to loose their job, their notoriety, their self respect? The only possible reason is money attraction .
There are only two subjects on earth that have the power to pervert people and to make them do anything crazy, those two subjects are love and money .
Therefore we can consider that love and money are the roots of all evil .
So money really perverts people, because if we look at the politics side we will see politicians playing with their money either to buy voters or trying to raise funds. Some organizations are known to use their money to commit crimes, murders, to buy or sell drugs, in one word, actually drug traffic .
Some countries use their power to buy weapons and then to sell them to other countries in need, during wars for instance. Some countries use their power and their money to help researchers in the elaboration of nuclear weapons that are each time more sophisticated and this for the country to acquire each time more power, and may be to be the leader in one field .
But sometimes countries want and need researchers not only for bad discoveries but also for good ones .
Actually all the industrialized world pays for scientific discoveries, we must not forget all the progress made in the medical field for example. Discoveries are also made during space researches. All thisrequire money .
If we look at it, all in all, we need money to make science and to build up history, to give it to those who don't possess it, to survive and even to live comfortably .
But some of us use it in a bad way that is either they want to earn more even if they resort to illegal transactions or they spend the money they have, to acquire power .
So, to sum it up there are pros and cons in money, it al depends on what you do with it .
