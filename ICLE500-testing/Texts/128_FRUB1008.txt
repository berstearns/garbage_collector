Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
On the contrary, according to me feminists have done more good than harm to the cause of women. Forty years ago the french philosopher Simone de Beauvoir declared that [Quotation] . It has been a difficult birth but today a woman's place is not only in the home. Women are more independent, more self-reliant, more confident and more powerful than ever before. Just look around: women are found in almost every profession. There are women doctors, professors, fire fighters and carpenter; we must not forget that Britain had a woman prime minister. Therefore and undoubtedly the women's liberation movement has made a remarkable progress, but there is still a long way to go. Many men argue that women are just not suitable for certain jobs, they say that they are weaker, more emotional and less practical than men. These arguments, however, are not convincing. Research has shown time and time again that the differences within each sex are greater taht the differences between them. There are just as many weak, emotional, unpractical men as there are strong and practical women. The major problem is one of prejudice, which is rooted in our upbringing and education. We say that women are adept with a needle and thread so why shouldn't they make first-class surgeons? We assume that women are better at listening and solving emotional problems than men, so why so few women priests? To some extent, I think that things will improve in the near future .
In the fifties Simone de Beauvoir's free woman was just being born, now in the nineties she is learning to walk. It is high time men ceased to regard women as second-class citizen. This is supposed to be an enlightened age, but you wouldn't think so if you could hear what the average man thinks of the average woman. Women, as I have already said, won their independence years ago. After a long struggle they now enjoy the same educational opportunities as men in most parts of the world. They have proved repeatedly that they are equal and often superior to men (yes, this is a man who is writing!!!) in almost every field. The battle for recognition has been won, but it is by no means over. It is men, not women who still carry on the sex war because their attitude remains hostile. Women continue to be regarded as second-class citizens. When you hear some men talk, you think that women belong to a different species. The same jokes about women drivers are repeated day after day. However we all know that women cause far fewer accidents than men. Moreover, women have succeeded in any job you care to name. As politicians, soldiers, doctors, university professors, company directors, scientists, presidents, etc... Yet men go on claiming that there are many jobs women cannot do. Top-level political negociation between countries, business and banking are almost entirely controlled by men, who jealously guard their so-called "rights". Even in enlightened places like Switzerland women haven't been given the vote. The arguments that men (except me!) put forward to exclude women from these fields are too familiar. Women, they say, are unreliable and irrational. They depend too little on cool reasoning and too much on intuition and instinct in order to arrive at decisions. They are not even capable of thinking clearly. Yet when women prove their abilities, men refuse to recognize them and give them their due. The truth is that men cling to their supremacy because of their inferiority complex. They know in their hearts that women are superior and they are afraid of being beaten at their own game. I think that one of the most important tasks in the world is to achieve peace between the nations and I claim that you can be sure that if women were allowed to sit round the conference table, they would succeed where men have failed for centuries. Some things are too important to be left to men...
