Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good When we think about the advances achieved by the feminists, we systematically call to mind the women's movement of the 60/70ies. We must not forget however that many of the goals that women have been trying to attain these last 30 years had already been fought for during the 19th century. Some preliminary signs of this fight can already be found in the late 18th century, when in 1792 Mary Wollstonecraft published [Reference] in which she rejects the image of the woman as a toy and pleads for the women's right to a decent education. And the fight is still going on. Rightly? Has not feminism served its time? Has it not eventually done more harm to the cause of women than good? In other words has feminism come to be beside the point?
Feminism originates in the need for the equality of the sexes. Has this equality been arrived at? In theory, it has been achieved because this right for equality has been put into legal terms. There is a legal principle of public international order that states the equality of the sexes. This certainly would not have happened without the feminist revolution .
We really should not overlook the good done by feminists to the cause of women. These two last decades have not seen many changes concerning women but there have been some. For instance, the obligatory mention of both sexes in advertisements for situations vacant or more recently the legal provisions as far as sexual harassment is concerned (although these provisions are not restricted to women, I guess mal victims are fewer in number than female ones).
Although there have been few changes which we can remember these last years, we really should take our hats off to feminists: they have been challenging a mentality established since the beginnings of the world and for a great part improving it. Is not one of the oldest traces of the representation of woman subordinated to man to be found in the Genesis? Is not woman said to have been born out of a man's rib? Was she not doomed to keep man company? Worse, is she not the one that sinned first?
The problem is that even if such an international principle for equality has been established, some countries still keep on violating it (mostly in countries where religion prevails over international rights). It is in these countries that improvements are needed. The fight is now reduced to a matter of controlling whether this principle is applied or not and is no longer the exclusive task of feminists .
When feminism stops fighting for equality, it begins to assert the superiority of woman upon man and such discourse is always alarming. Feminists have done enough good for the cause of women, let us prevent them from doing too much .
