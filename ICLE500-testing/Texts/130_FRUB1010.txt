Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
In this essay I will deal with the intricate and tricky problem of the feminism. The question that arises here is: Is it so that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good? I will attempt to show that their actions have brought not only advantages to women but inconveniences too .
First of all, it is important to highlight the fact that the situation of women greatly improved this last century. They gained the right to vote, to give their opinion, and to involve themselves into the working life .
Moreover, women were freed from men's authority, they began to go to school, and therefore to work, to earn their own living. In other words they obtained independence and freedom. But they had to battle fiercely to reach that stage of affair and sometimes they even had to resort to violence in order to obtain satisfaction. Here, let me remind you of the fact that most men were totally opposed to this emancipation, they regarded women as stupid and inferior human beings whose duty was to stay at home, to keep house, to cook the meal, and above all to take care of the children .
What is more, although a lot of progress has been made on that ground, women have not reached equality yet and it is highly possible that they will never be considered to be the equals to men. There are nevertheless some obvious reasons for this. First, women are not entitled to do heavy labour as men are. Second, a lot of men still believe that women are inferior, they consider that the members of the weaker sex have to obey them and to submit to their wishes .
Finally, women are still put at a disadvantage when they apply for a job. Sexism has always been present in that case and some people seem to be of the opinion that it will never disappear. As a matter of fact, some employers take on members of the stronger sex more willingly than those of the weaker sex. Others still refuse to collaborate with female beings or to have them as manager. Others have a tendency to underpay women, that is to say that they offer them lower wages than those they would give to men in the same position..
Then, now that most women are working it has been noticed that the number of divorces is constantly increasing. Nowadays, women are free to leave the marital home if there are problems and that happens because they are now financially independent. Needless to say that such a thing would never have happened in the past when they were dependent on men. At the time they had no other alternative than to accept lfie as it was, to submit to their husband and to put up a good show .
An other problem women have to face is the overload of work: they have indeed to cope with their job, with their households, and with their children. No wonder that so much work wears them out and that they collapse either mentally or physically. Afterall, you cannot bite off more than you can chew .
As a conclusion, women have gained freedom and independence thanks to the feminist movement, their situation has greatly improved, they are no longer a slave two their husband, they are no longer mere objects the duty of which is to keep house. But, as the proverb says, [Quotation] and women have to accept the other side of the coin, that is to say inconveniences, problems, sexism, heavy labour, rivalry, and competition .
