Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. This claim witnesses not only a certain uneasiness on the part of the students but also a more general feeling of emptiness. Oddly enough, it is simultaneously a rather contemporary idea and a universal doubt. I have chosen to regard this reality from the student's point of view, for he is the most concerned .
In the first instance, it is of importance to analyse properly the signification of "real world". Does it refer to the working life, or to the practical knowledge of one's activity in life? Should we read in this assertion an implied contrast between two successive stages in one's life: the first, theoretical knowledge found in books, preparing the following step, the actual use of this cognizance? Clearly it states that academic knowledge has divorced from real world, that university is no school of life .
How could one agree with such a biased view. I propose in this essay to enlight the subject from a more nuanced angle. Before I set up my arguments, I would like to underline the fact that one has to distinguish between different sorts of intelligences, which should ideally complement each other. This consideration brings me to the core of the problem, the central flaw of the education system .
Admittely, one fails to bridge the gap between formal learning, that has been piled up since early times, the synthesis of which you get acquainted with at university; and the accurate understanding of it followed by an adequate actualisation .
At this point we may wonder if the task of professors goes as far as to lead us step by step, prudently spoonfeeding us; in order to help us pass successfully from the stage of understanding, integrating knowledge to the judicious release of it with regard to the existential situation. Opinions are divided on this question, but as far as I am concerned, I truly believe that this task can only be performed by each student individually. However, one is bound to take into account the fact that obviously students are still expecting an external guide to conduct them on the road of life .
Looking at the problem from a positive point of view, there is nevertheless no denying that university opens our intellectual horizons. But it does not account for an inward maturing process, built on discursive emotions, experiences pleasant, impressive, instructive, as well as disruptive, shocking or sterile; recondite sensations, feelings that teach us about human beings in their imperfections, and struggles to betterment .
The point I am making holds ground only if one considers the term "real world" in the sense, school of life, practical intelligence necessary to understand the complexity of human beings and adapt oneself in the world. Contrary to what might be thought, to my mind, this knowledge cannot be extracted from books. It is an experimental and personal learning. For example, others' mistakes rarely serve as warnings. In literature, as well hundreds of lives, problems, issues unfold before the reader's very eyes without having him take benefit of this precious experience .
I probably only touched upon the problem, and there remains a great deal more to say on this subject, but unfortunately the lenght restriction allowed me only to scrutinize the tip of the iceberg .
To return to the preliminary remark that a general feeling of emptiness prompted some students to doubt about the value of their university degrees; I am not alone in thinking that our modern society experiences a turning point. The advancing progress of technology and science in every field is not accompanied by a similar move in the field of ethics. The philosophical and ethical emptiness lies in this growing delay. In that case, doubts arise as to what extent universty still fulfills a role that society fails to provide .
As a conclusion, I am of the opinion that this respectable house of knowledge teaches us to learn rather than to comprehend the obscure mechanisms of human soul. I feel that the gist of knowledge manifests itself in our ability to expatiate it in the real world. This can be visualised as a delicious fruit that is not eatable unless one knows how to make it ripen. Therefore, in absolute terms, theoretical knowledge taught at university is not of no value. The responsability rests on the desire each of us invests in combining books' knowledge with his life's experience. And as Rabelais said each one is free to "extract the substantial marrow" or to ignore it .
