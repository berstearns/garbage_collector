Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
All over the world, money is used for measuring value, for storing wealth and for buying or selling goods. This explains why money is so important and so necessary in our modern society .
Unfortunately money also corrupts society and its members, for people view it as an aim rather than as a means. And the words of the old saying "money is the root of all evil" may turn out to be true .
Our modern society is regulated by a capitalist economy. In such a society people's duty is to increase their wealth. Everyone tries to protect his own interest, and at the same time neglects the interests of others. Moreover money is linked with the notion of power, rich people often occupy important positions in society. The poorest people moan about the successes and rewards of others. They make envious remarks and become jealous. So money provokes covetousness, bitterness and resentment. It may even cause hatred and violence. This makes it obvious that greed is one of the most important problem, which we have to deal with in our society. The strong desire for money can indeed destroy happy families, it is quite common to see children quarrelling over money after their parent's death. Money can provoke war between countries. Everyone should remember Sadam Hussein's attack on Kuweit. Sadam's invasion can hardly be justified, when it is explained that Kuweit is one of the richest countries in the world. He saw in this country the perfect means to increase his wealth and power. Sadam's plan shows that some people resort to illegal and dishonest means to gain money. They steal from others what they dream of, or swindle their contemporaries without any remorse. What is quite alarming is that most people forget that money is a means, not an aim. Consequently they reject real human values, which are : honesty, love of one's neighbour, respect, solidarity and charity toward others. Even the most honest people can be tempted to satisfy their craving for money. However money in itself is not bad. It simply depends on what people do with it. It can not be denied that money is one of the basis of our modern society, it enables people to live in a decent and comfortable way, by supplying all their needs. Without money it would be impossible to buy the most essential goods .
Of course the richer people are, the easier it becomes for them to acquire these goods .
Money gives other satisfactions as well. How would it be possible without any money to help people who are in trouble? How could society fight against poverty, starvation, sickness and all the other social ills? Money also contributes to the development in science, art and technology. And finally it appears as a means of collective utility by assuring people's well-being through the creation of a good administration, through the maintenance of an army and the development of cultural structures. So money is an important factor contributing to the progress and stability of our society .
To conclude money is useful, as long as it helps people to respect true human values and to put them into practice. But if it used for another purpose, it has to be condemned and rejected - like any evil force .
