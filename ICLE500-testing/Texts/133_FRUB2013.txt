Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money, the root of ALL evil? Certainly not, many other factors contribute to the degeneration of our civilization. Nevertheless I think money can claim being number one in that matter! Let us think of the influence money has at the level of the individual, and then at the more general level of the country .
In our merely materialistic world, money has gained such a high status that nearly reaches the level of moral value such as trust, good morality. Indeed it has become one of the criterias on which people set up judgments about the moral qualities of others. Money can even be considered as a kind of synonym for honesty, courage, intelligence, ... Moreover it is also considered as a key to success, and, therefore, as people believe, a key to happiness, which is the quest of most of us. From the moment someone finds it, envy and jealousy arise. And as bad thinking is not far from bad action, we can easily explain a high rate of thefts, hold-ups, attacks,... That has also its effect on the atmosphere and relationship between people : discomfort, fear, distrust, ... From another point of view, money causes problems in the way it is not fairly shared out among people. In other words we have rich and poor people. That raises the question of equality among men, injustice and ostracism also find expression in frustration, and once again in violence. So in this section I have shown very quickly and superficially, some of the consequences and problems caused by money .
On a larger scale, money can also affect the lives of millions of people. Indeed all nations in the world aim at gaining power, and that is mainly achieved through money. This dream, or rather obsession of power of some leaders can give way to disasters. Indeed Saddam Hussein invaded Koweit for its strategic situation and gas resources. But that need also meant thousands of victims, and could have set off a new world war. And we all know that any war allows all atrocities we can imagine. Isn't this the ultimate expression, the mirror of evil?
In those two preceeding sections, I have dealt with some of the problems caused by "money inequality". But the biggest problem lies in the lack of money, in those people who don't have any money at all. In our society, we need money for anything: food, clothes, home, ... Without the basic necessities, people can get ill and even die. In the same way, a country without money cannot help feeding its population, which starves and dies as we witness in some African countries. Here again we find in misery and death the incarnation of evil .
So I think money is responsible for many of our problems, notably social ones. But we could hardly make it without money. Unfortunately it has lost much of its primary function as a trade exchange value and has gained too much social value .
