Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Nowadays, television invades our daily life. Most families spend the whole evening in front of their television set. The first thing that some people do in the morning is to switch their television on, which clearly reveals how much they value the screen. Sometimes two or three apparels belong to one household. Young children are probably still more influenced by television programmes than adults: they play at soldiers, at killing each others; they see the world in a two-valued orientation, just like television do: those are the bad ones, these are the good ones. Lots of people identify with actors and would do anything to resemble them. Moreover, television characters encroach on our everyday life not only through television, but also by means of clothes, dolls, ... On the whole, the impact of television in our society is clear enough. But what is the real purpose of television?
Television broadcasts display informative and entertaining programmes. However, one should wonder whether the primary function of television is to inform or to entertain .
Some people argue that the basic purpose of television is to divert us from the cruel reality of the world. The screen would help them to take their minds off their worries, problems and, perhaps, responsibilities. But aren't the films sometimes more violent than the reality? It is not rare for broadcasts to show men behaving in the worst possible manner .
On the other hand, news broadcasts are not always pleasing to see. We are usually confronted with frightening pictures of war, hate, disease, hunger, etc. to mention only a few. And we can't really say that such terrible happenings are relaxing. Nevertheless, even if the truth is sometimes difficult to cope with, it is necessary to know the world in which we are living .
Television is probably the best way of receiving quick information. We not only hear, but also see what is happening. We therefore get a better understanding of what is going on. In addition, television sometimes provides very good broadcasts about the beauty of nature or about the different cultures of the world. And we can also watch various programmes which are both entertaining and informative. These broadcasts help us not only to relax, but also to broaden our mind .
In a nutshell, television has two different purposes: to entertain and inform its public. Indeed the screen presents us with a range of frivolous programmes. These are either inoffensive and really diverting broadcasts or violent ones which could have negative effects on people. Other programmes can both inform and entertain. These are considered to be more serious and more constructive divertissments. They are certainly not a waste of time. In short, it should always be remembered that television is one of the most important media nowadays. Lots of different people of differing ages and with various tastes spend hours in front of their television. As television aims at pleasing its viewers, the best compromise is probably the showing of both entertaining and informative programmes .
But what should we think of the film on the Waco tragedy? Filming started one month after the siege had begun. Of course, this film may have some positive aspects: it concentrates on Koresh's evolution from his religious upbringing to the charismatic man that he became, and this may help us to understand his personality better. And maybe will we be able to comprehend why so many people have followed him. But, on the other hand, is not this filming of a tragedy which at the time was not yet unfolded a kind of voyeurism?
To sum up, television has similar effects to those of opium. Opium is a drug which reduces people's pain and causes them to sleep. Similarly, television turns out to be a drug when people can't do without it, when they absolutely need to watch their favourite programmes. Television also induces passivity, a kind of intellectual sleep. So if television is probably the most effective way of being informed, it may also reveal itself as being a powerful device to manipulate people .
