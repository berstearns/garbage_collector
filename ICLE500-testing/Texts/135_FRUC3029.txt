Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
If you ask a child what his plans are for the coming holidays, he will no doubt select activities such as watching the television or playing with the computer. This is very convenient for parents. On one hand, if they are not at home, these "games" can easily take place at Granny's home or at the baby-sitter's. On the other hand, if they are present, little time has to be devoted to organize these so-called leisure!
Moreover, the television programmes children choose are not always the best ones. The most striking examples are cartoons .
How can you expect a child to have or to develop imagination from a pseudo science-fictional background? T-V. programmes also become as uninteresting as repetitions .
As opposed to that, nature and literature are an unexhaustible source of dreams and imagination. Few children however are still interested in long walks through woods and fewer are in the reading of novels or poems. This lack of interest is certainly one of the fundamental reason of this "imaginational breakdown".
Another collapsing pillar of the imagination and dreaming is adventure. The increasing package tours clearly shows that people do not seek adventure anymore. Some parents consider their holidays as a big baby-sitting party. Subscribing to such trips, they know that activities will be organized for their children as well as for themselves. They are advised not to worry, enjoy themselves and spend as much money as they can. Can such organization, uniformity and idleness really lead to the imagination's development?
Furthermore, the golden motto is "enjoy yourself EFFORTLESSLY". Why then would one face a difficulty when it is so convenient to turn one's back to it? Children only think in terms of effort if there is a reward, and not any reward, a material one if possible. They are not taught to open their eyes, ears and nose. They do not not enjoy looking at nature because they do not see, hear or smell it. That problem has to be dealt with by educational means. The best method is to teach ourselves first .
Every adult is a teacher who has to set an example to children. Being models, grown-ups are constantly imitated by children. If the latter lack imagination, so do the former .
Some people think that reality is built up on science, technology, and industrialisation. On the contrary, if our society is not decadent yet, it is due to people gifted with dreaming and imagination powers: They are not only concerned by production, uniformity and organization; humour, fantasy, literature and adventure are certainly as important for them .
They can still be struck with amazement. Is that true for children? I doubt it. They think every technological achievement is obvious, and financial consequences seem to be the companies' main concerns .
This estonishment being rare, I wonder where people still find pleasure, certainly not in bringing up children! If the next generations do not tackle these problems seriously, some more steps will have been taken towards a real Brave New World .
