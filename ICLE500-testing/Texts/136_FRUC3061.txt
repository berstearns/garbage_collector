Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
What Marx meant by religion as the opium of the masses can be understood as followed. Let us begin with the word "opium". This word reminds us of the important part that religion played in the 19th century. Religion was present at the social as well as the political and intellectual level and nobody would challenge its foundation. This may explain why people were "religion addicted" and could do nothing without a religious approval of their behaviour. People needed religion!
Moreover, religion was an easy means for the authorities to make people accept their bad situation on earth by promising a better life after death .
If Marx was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. Let us therefore take a closer look at television as the opium of the masses .
First, it is generally agreed today that people are slaves of television. Consider the case of children. They have only just come back from school when they switch on television and watch cartoons. When their mother asks them about their homework, they answer that they will do it later. In my view, watching television should be a reward for their work .
Added to that, the breakfast television on Saturday and Sunday prevents them from sleeping, playing outside with other children, or going for a walk in the countryside. Our children do not move anymore. They are sitting all the time and do not have any physical training so that the adults of tomorrow will easier be heart patients. It is not only harmful to their health but it gives them a bad picture of society. These cartoons are full of violence, war, death and blood, which strongly influence their games and their vision of the world .
They even go as far as to believe that such a life is normal .
Secondly, television, just like religion in the 19th century, is used by the authorities to keep people in a dream .
They decide what can be broadcast or not, and they make a strong selection. Adults, like children, are slaves of television. They watch soap operas, full of love, money and beauty. Television gives them an idealistic view of life and people make more attempts to live like this than to fight against real problems. People are not interested in pollution, equality of blood, equality of sex, religion, politics or terrorism. They put off all problems. But we must make it absolutely clear that television is a way to alter the truth .
And it cannot be denied that television influences our life at a political, social and economical level. One of the most striking examples is advertising. The housewife will easier buy a product she saw on television than another, even if the latter is less expensive or of better quality. Television is far from holding the monopoly of truth. Please, think about it before switching it on!
