Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
A new regulation is being enforced concerning advertisement on cigarettes. Police are more and more hard towards alcohol abuse, especially while driving. Customs officers and the anti-drug brigade are constantly developping new techniques to detect drug traffic, and dealers are punished with life imprisonment. However the authorities seem to ignore completely another important factor people are slaves to: television. Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace it with television .
We would like to demonstrate that television lost its didactive role a long time ago. It has now become a sure means for the great men of our society to force people into doing exactly what they are expected to do. What is very disturbing is that the influence of television seems to make itself felt in all generations: children, adolescents as well as adults .
Let's first consider the children. Just back from school, they rush into the armchair in front of the tvset. They would not miss that famous animated cartoon where the hero can kill anyone who upsets him! The time of the sweet and beautiful princesses is over. They have been replaced by strong warriors with the most modern weapons. For his birthday, the child absolutely wants his own "Ninja Turtle", the one you see on television. He will grow up with the preestablished ideas that society wants him to have. Children are being manipulated by images which make them long for monster-toys. They are the innocent victims of our materialistic world which has left no place for individual freedom .
No wonder that a child like that can not get rid of these ideas when he reaches the adolescence. More than ever, the teenager wants to assert himself in life. But, being confronted with all kinds of new events such as love, responsabilities or just physical changes, he does not know how to do it. Therefore he will conform to the stereotypes proposed by television. He will listen to the latest hits, drink Coca-Cola, wear those new clothes and so obey the rules of the great men of society .
We will finally deal with the generation of adults. The housewife only buys the washing-powder shown on television .
Her husband looks at the news. He only sees one side of the picture but he does not realize it. The journalists ' speech is convincing enough for him to believe this is the only truth. All this forces us into thinking that people are becoming addicted to television .
We have proved that television has become one of the major factors which influence our everyday life on all levels .
It has destruted our own personality and our family life. It has replaced our own opinions and indicted us with stereotypes ideas. The world has become a slave to the tvset: we do and think exactly what it wants. Some people may find it exaggerated. They may not agree on this association between television and opium. Those people should try to turn off their television for just one week. They would then have time for walking or telling their children about the old fairy tales... but they will surely not stand it very long: she will want to see the following of her favourite serial, he will not miss the live football match. They will soon implore: Give us please our TV back!
