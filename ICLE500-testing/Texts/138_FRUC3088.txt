Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
To the reader: This is not a formal essay: It is a dreamy essay .
It is true that na√Øvety, dreaming and imagination are irremediably losing ground in our modern and highly civilized societies .
To begin with, all kinds of "irrational religions" which include more than one god or worship non-human divinities have been abolished. The civilizations which went on following their traditions were called "primitives", and there was a strong urge on the part of the western missionaries to teach them our modern principles and exploit them. So a mercantile interest overshadowed genuine and peaceful communities .
But now, it is religion itself which is somewhat losing importance in the life of the modern man. Some basic values and religious virtues are outdated, and finally no more reguarded as crucial. The modern man can peacefully enjoy life with the new prospects now offered to him by science, high technology and industry. He has got his personal comfort, his hous, his car, his television, his work, his funny gadgets, and he can have fun with the next-door girl. Why should he refuse?
Through history, religion was basically felt as a need, a help for the poor hungry masses that were busy trying to survive .
They could only appease their fears and misfortunes; find their hopes in religion. Religion was useful to keep them living and working .
Just as religion is more or less losing this "utility" in our modern world, dreaming and imagination are following the same way .
If you want to succeed in this society you only have to study, work hard, be intelligent, be beautiful, have money, and forget about the rest. No matter if people are unhappy around you! Instead of taking their human feelings into account, what you have to do in business is to try to solve a problem by means of figures, dollars, subsidies, profits... by counting, calculating and making abstraction of data of any other kind .
The most promising jobs in the future are those that involve finance, trade, business, diplomacy thus excluding dreaming and imagination we would find in the arts, for instance .
As a concrete example, I can mention what a young american student in economics told me during my holidays Singapore .
He is only twenty, comes from a rich family, he is beautiful, he has travelled a lot all over the world, he goes to one of the best universities in the States - I mean Yale - he has everything we could dream of. We had a talk about studies, and when I told him I was about to begin my last year in germanic philology, he replied that it must be all very well and funny to listen to some literature, history and philosophy, but that all this was really useless and that it wouldn't lead me very far if I wanted to have some kind of career worthy of this name .
Anyway, how sad would the world be if everybody was busy with economics!
We had some kind of "privilege relationship", and I was interested in the guy. But as I was not staying for a long time - I had to take the plane two weeks after - he tried to make me understand that it was impossible, that he was sad too but that I was really too irrational, that I was an idealist .
He, on the other hand, thought he had a good point at being an extremely realistic, materialistic man. He carefully warned me: Pay attention and take care of yourself. If you are too idealistic, you are going to fall back on the ground one day and suffer a great deal .
This is the kind of world we are living in right now. But without any dream we are just machines; perhaps we suffer but we do not feel any true joy either. And maybe in this world of machinery, pollution and high technology, the man will again feel the need to go back to his roots, live more simply and give some more place to sincere relationships and dreams .
