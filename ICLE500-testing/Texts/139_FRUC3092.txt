Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
To understand how universities have been created in Occident, we have to go back to the Middle Ages. Only a few monks or future monks were concerned with school at that time. Cut off the real world they were gathering in monasteries or schools where they were learning through old books, most of the time about antiquity. They were said to have a vocation for this kind of life. Universities have developped in this way since the 12th century .
But what about these prestigious institutions today? To caricature them rapidly one could say that universities consist of courses given by professors (competent in their fields) in front of a silent audience who is conscientiously taking notes. So one can wonder if a university degree really prepare students for real world and what his value is nowadays .
I think it is true that lectures in themselves are theoretical. Firstly because students spend most of their time sitting in big classrooms which do not allow practical exercises but only ex cathedra lectures. Secondly because the subjects of the lectures are theoretical. For example: during a general methodology course (which, we think, could be more practical) different theories as Krashen's, Lado's or ?
studied in detail but practical points are hardly ever considered .
However is it true that this formation does not prepare students for real world? I am of the opinion that the answer is no. First I think that university degrees are theoretical on purpose (as opposed to high schools which are more practical.) The reason is that, thanks to the theoretical background they have learned, university students are able to build up their own way to achieve their aim. Moreover they are also able to adapt or to modify their method according to the situation. To take the example of a teacher again, I could say that a teacher in front of a classroom do not think about particular methodological theories again but that he has created his own methodology. Secondly, I think that academic studies develop a critical mind. The students are indeed trained to analyse pieces of information coming from different horizons from a critical point of view, which means that they have to dissect them, to confront them and then to be able to pass judgment on them. That is the way they should create a personal opinion for themselves .
Nevertheless, I do not want to go too far. I really think that theory is essential but I am convinced that practice should also be present. Let's take the example of a student in economics who has his certificate in his pocket and proudly goes working in a big firm for the first time. I would compare this business man to a gentleman who perfectly knows the highway code and who knows how to start and how to run through the gears but who finds himself in the center of Paris at the peak hours the first time he really drives! By this example, I want to show that theory must always be accompagnied by practical applications, which is not often the case at university. I think that this is a fully justified criticism against this institution .
So what about the value of university degrees? I really think that they are of great value because they can turn out intellectuals of high level. But they would be more effective and closer to everyday life if they were more practical (university students can still sometimes be compared to the monks of the 12th century!) These changes have been considered and some reform projects have already been carried out: there was a seminar about this subject and "méta courses" ("méta" stands for "métamorphose") were organised last year. I hope we will go further in this direction .
