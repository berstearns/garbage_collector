Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Experience is a major asset for any job applicant, and this very common requirement in job offers seems to corroborate the statement according to which "most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world, (and that) they are therefore of very little value."
This opinion however can be criticized on several grounds .
Although it is true that most university degrees are theoretical, it does not mean that they do not prepare students for the "real world", or professional world where they will have to put what they have learned into practice. A
chemist who has just recently graduated from college will probably take more time to make a pharmaceutical preparation than a practically trained lab technician, but after a time, when he has gained experience, he will be as good as him, and what is more, he will be able to understand what he is doing, being able to detect possible mistakes made by the general practitioner. Furthermore, he will always have a kind of overview on whatever he will do, which the technician, trapped in his mechanical routine, will never have. We here find an illustration of one of the university graduate's major assets: his critical sense. His theoretical studies must have given him the tools to think for himself and not to accept everything he is told without further analysis .
University studies also form students to be methodical and organized. they must be able to see at once what is important in each of the different subjects their curriculum includes, and to assimilate it in such a way that they will be able to render it at the exam, showing they have understood it. This will provide them with an analytical spirit, another great asset in their future life, when they will be confronted with entirely new situations for which they will have to find straightforward solutions .
Next to those qualities, university also gives students the opportunity to meet people from various backgrounds: geographical, social, intellectual, ... and they should make the most of it, talking and exchanging ideas, trying to understand other mentalities, learning to respect people who are different from them. Various programs even give students the chance to go abroad, and this probably is the best preparation for the "real" world. Their degree will indeed give them the skills necessary for their future profession, even if they first need some time to adapt to its practice, but they will have gained something more essential from their contacts with other people: an open mindedness which will make them aware that their professional or familial world is but a small part of a much larger one, which might rightly be called "the real world."
