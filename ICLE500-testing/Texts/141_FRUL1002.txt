Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
When I am dreaming about past times I see little villages surrounded by dark woods and many children who gather around the fireplace. A very old grandmother is sitting in the rocking chair and is telling fairy tales. In summer, while people are working together in the fields, their children are playing with horses, dogs and sheep. They call their favourite baby chicken Peep .
This image would probably fit for the background of some pastoral but it is of course far from reality. Even before mankind was dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there may have been little space for dreaming and imagination although the reasons must have been quite different. But let us now shift to our modern world in which dreams first seem to have no place left .
At a very young age children have to attend school where they spend many hours of the day. When they return home they have to prepare lessons for the next day, they have to learn lists of vocabulary or they have to write an essay. There is not much free time left and besides the pupils' brains are so overflown with new knowledge that there cannot be much space left for dreaming. When they become adults they will have to function in another kind of dull routine: they will have to work more or less hard to earn their living. And after having spent some fourty hours per week in an often anonymous grey box, they are happy to sit before the telly or the video while their children are fighting with a game boy .
These mass medias and computer games do not only prevent the mind from dreaming but they do also build up a wall of isolation between people. Moreover in the big towns there are hardly green spaces where people could meet and sit and imagine "what would be if...?". Thus they have to stay inside the grey buildings .
And when by accident they watch an emission about for instance gene technology they will get completely desillusioned: today science is able to mutilate existing forms of life or even to create new varieties of some species; thus nature is virtually cut into pieces and every single aspect of the being is to be explained. In the scientific world the stress is laid on reason not on feelings!
But technology has had some positive effects as well: much work has become easier through new inventions and much time can be spared. Instead of doing some boring housework, the housekeeper can sit down and read an intereting book .
Furthermore when the social security system of a nation is well elaborated, people need not fear any longer too much about money and they might find some more time for day-dreaming .
Maybe they are even able to realize such a dream as a holiday in India. But at least they can make real more decent wishes as going to a museum, as assisting to a concert of Irish folk music or as going to a new theatre in town. People thus may spend some creative hours thanks to medias and shrinking distances between places. In other words culture is diffused and open to a larger public .
If you still hesitate whether even today people may dream and be imaginative or not, you ignore the existence of art. The work of an artist often expresses some revolt against existing habits, rigid point of views and unsatisfactory situations .
There are many creative artists nowadays who continually give us proofs of their imagination .
It would be the wrong way to hope that dreaming and imagination could transform our modern society into a newly coloured and eventually more desirable world. But each person should try to leave some little space in their minds to be prepared for a creative event to take place .
Even in our world it is still possible to find a calm place near a river where in summer you can lie on your back .
You watch the white clouds in the sky - they are sheep and among them runs a big raindog. Or you take a small pebble in your hand, feel how it warms up and you imagine the little creature living inside of it .
