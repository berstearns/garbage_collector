Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Marx, who was one of the great social economists and society theorists of the last century, would never have guessed, what the evolution would be in the twentieth century .
But he saw already clearly that the masses were exploited by the leading class, anyway what kind of leading class it was. So his idea was that the substrcture should liberate itself from the superstructure. If there were no more leaders, all men would be equal. But this could only happen, if the people were conscious that they were exploited and if they knew that they could change their position. Marx's idea was that the religion was the tranquilliser that calmed down the people and that prevented them from revolting against the ruling class, the factory owners and the clerics. So, he created the sentence that religion was the opium for the masses .
If we analyse this sentence, we first have to analyse the nouns "opium" and "religion". Opium is a drug and drugs can be used in different ways. They are bad if you consume them in bigger, non-pure doses and this has different consequences. You don't see the world anymore clearly as it is, you find to another kind of perception of the world, and they ease the psychological pain you suffer in this world. But drugs can be good as well. If you take the right doses, they ease your physical pain and they calm you down. Religion, and Marx meant especially Christianity, can also be used in different ways. If the believer concentrates too much on it, it might be bad, because you loose connection with the real world. You only look for your own salvation, you are no more interested in world affairs, and you might follow your leaders and think no more for yourself. But if you have the right view to Christianity, which was indeed very difficult at the time of Marx, it leads you to be critical towards society and its rulers, it makes you open-minded and friendly, and you try to treat everybody equally .
Could Marx, if he was alive at the end of the twentieth century, replace religion with television? Before answering this question, we have to analyse TV in the same way as we did with religion and opium. Things that were important for religion and opium are also relevant for television. It has its good and its bad sides. If you are not critical and don't choose but just consume, than you are overloaded with useless information, you don't distinguish anymore between reality and fiction, and you learn the wrong things because others create your opinion through TV. But if you don't watch too much and if you select carefully, you are well informed about what is going on in the world, you may learn a lot of interesting things without travelling around, and you can learn something in a short time and whenever you want with the video recorder .
If we compare the points we analysed in religion and in TV, we discover two points in common. when you have the wrong attitude to religion and to TV, you are guided by others and you are not open for changes. On the other side, you are more critical and open-minded, more open for changes when you have the right attitude towards both. But Marx would probably not have replaced religion by television because the nineteenth century is much too different from the twentieth and things have changed rapidly. Today people are much more free than people were at the time of Marx to do and not to do whatever they want. At that time, people couldn't choose to be in the church or not because there was too much pressure from society .
But today you are totally free to turn the television on or off and which channel you choose. Marx would probably have been so intelligent to take this into account .
