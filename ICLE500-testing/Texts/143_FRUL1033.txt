Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
In our society, science, technology and industrialisation have become three inseparable words. They are inevitably linked together. The sciences represent the acquired knowledge thanks to the discovery of laws and phenomena. People do not generally succeed in perceiving such a knowledge which seems out of reach. Although science and technology are part of our everyday life they remain at a level which goes beyond the human sensibility. Three conditions are needed in order to keep up with industrialisation: an important capital, available labour force and technological progress. A technological revolution took place in Europe two centuries ago and, nearer to us, we all remember the technological revolution of the seventies .
Now that people live with technology, distrust is the general attitude we adopt when we think about progress. The old, omnipotent faith in progress has disappeared. But I do not think that we will draw back. When Man makes a step he wants to go further and he will therefore make a second one .
If you tell me that because of the fact that we are living in such a society, we are no more able to dream, my opinion goes the opposite way. It is not possible to live without dreaming and imagination. Life would become so dull that we would attend an upsurge of nervous breakdowns, the most of them leading to suicide. I may sound a bit pessimistic but that is not the case .
From a medical point of view, Freud has already explained that people cannot live without dreaming otherwise their mental balance would be disturbed. Do not trust people who tell you that they do not dream: they do even if they are not aware of it .
We do not have less time for dreaming than before because in big firms man has been replaced by the machine. This is the principle of mechanization. What finished goods prices concerns: the lowest, the best because competition lays down the law. The employees have no choice: they have to get used to technology, they have to learn how to use new techniques. Their training must be almost complete before they enter the firm otherwise they will soon lag behind. There lies the problem: in trying to adapt. When you reach a certain age, it is not always easy to change your habits and to take new things in rapidly .
The life of someone who cannot get used to those techniques becomes a hell. If you have been worried the whole day, it is not easy to forget about your work when you come back home. In order to avoid the nervous breakdown, you have to overcome your problems. We all need dreaming and imagination as a kind of escape from a sometimes very dull reality. So many things can help us to dream: listening to music, reading a book, practising a sport...
Those moments are not expensive and yet, how they are precious!
Nowadays people are always in a hurry; you hear them say: "Well, I have no time, you know..." I think that they adopt the wrong attitude. The problem is not that they have no time but that they do not even take the time. Have you ever realized that the simple fact of thinking enables us to forget reality .
Do not tell me that a thought takes so much time .
What can we say about people during the war who kept on hoping and believing in the future? Where did they find the will to carry on when the present had nothing but gloomy prospects to offer? Although the world around them was collapsing, they must have been thinking about better days. When you are confident of something, this gives you an incredible power. We all have a purpose in life, something we want to reach, the aim for which we keep hoping. It is a way for us to give a sense to our life .
And we all know that hope implies dreaming because we only hope for things that have not yet happened .
Nothing can prevent human beings from dreaming and it is precisely when things go wrong that we tend to dream and hope for a better life. A machine does not dream; human beings do .
As a conclusion, I would like to tell people who find it difficult to escape in a world of their own that singing a song is not as stupid as people think it is. After all, does not singing always give a matter for dreaming?
