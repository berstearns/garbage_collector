Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Nowadays few women think of themselves as feminists. The Women's Lib is out of fashion and seems to belong to a remote past. A reason for this may be that women no longer feel the need of a dramatic change, since their social, political and professional situation considerably improved over the last decades. But what have feminists actually achieved? Are there no battles left to fight? Could feminism harm the cause of women?
Up until the twentieth century most women had very few rights and opportunities. Men considered them as physically and intellectually inferior. For example in the nineteenth century a married woman was, according to the law, her husband's property and she had to give him all that she owned. Women could hardly get a divorce, although a lot of them were mistreated. They were allowed to study at Oxford and Cambridge but could not receive a degree. In factories and workhouses women worked themselves to death .
Feminism's first aim was to demonstrate that women are equal to men in all respects, which led to practical changes. The suffragettes won British women the full franchise in 1928.
Women also got the right to ask for a divorce. More and more women graduated from universities. Salaries were raised and work conditions were improved. Thanks to their higher education level women became more independent and were better equipped to fight for their rights .
However it should be thought that all women are treated as they should be. In many non-western countries women are still exploited and oppressed. Despite the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in Great-Britain on the one hand and affirmative action in the United-States on the other hand, the principle of equal pay for equal work is not always applied and women find it hard to be appointed to positions of responsibility. Housewives get little social recognition, except in Scandinavia where they are paid for their work .
Feminism undoubtedly helped to improve the condition of women .
Still it cannot be denied that at times Women's Libbers go a bit too far. Some extremists would like to change the spelling of women to womyn in order to avoid the ending in - men which reminds them of the plural form of the word man. Others coin the term herstory to refer to the study of women's affairs .
They seem to ignore that the first syllable of history has etymologically nothing to do with a masculine prefix. In Germany some suggest modifying the indefinite pronoun man (one) because it sounds like Mann (man).
Feminists not only are good at making fools of themselves, but also turn out to have a gift for discrediting themselves (and women in general) in the eyes of men. Everybody knows that if one wants to be respected by someone, one has to respect that person first. Everybody except some feminists who behave so aggressively towards men that these come to consider women as frustrated pests .
Have feminists done more harm to the cause of women than good?
No, because changes were needed. But they should make sure that they keep the golden mean .
