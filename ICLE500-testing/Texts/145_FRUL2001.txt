Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
What strikes me about Marx's original sentence is its provocative aspect. To compare religion and its medium, the church, to a drug is a clear statement. Opium at that time was mainly used as a tranquillizer for sick people in hospitals and was still a legal drug. It is true that some people became opium addicted, in most cases as a consequence of the unknown effects that opium can have on a man's body, if the doses are not controlled by a specialized doctor. Marx saw that religion was used in the same way as the drug. It was meant to satisfy all the people's needs and as an answer to all questions. As a philosopher, Marx clearly recognized the manipulation done by the church, their priests and their interpretation of the Bible. Therefore he claimed the liberation and emancipation from religion .
But nowadays the situation has changed. Most churches, especially the traditional ones, share the same problem which is that of becoming more and more unpopular. Religion and faith do not have the same importance they had a century ago. Already the Roman [Illegible word/phrase] knew the basic needs of the masses: "panem et circenses". But the question of bread is not one of life or death nowadays, and most people only turn to religion on such occasions as a funeral or christmas Day, another institution became to play the centre part in every's life and that is television .
This phenomenon became clearly visible in the last two decades and has not reached its climax yet. The main reason for this is that TV satisfies the basic desire to be entertained. So it is not surprising to find at least one TV set in every household. It is the number one mass media. TV not only transmits news and information, game shows and the latest sport results, but also commercials, and this turns out to be its only purpose. The effects of television on our culture have already been described by such authors as Neil Postman, who shows the influence that commercials have. Since TV producers depend on the money paid by the advertisers not only the structure of the TV programme has changed but also our capability of telling reality from fiction. It is well known that films and even the news are splitted into fragments to allow the industries to praise their products, but rather unknown what effect this has on the quality of the programme. The lower its level of comprehension, the better, as if its aim was to be bad that the break for the commercials might function as the climax of the programme. It seems that even the seriousness of the news can not be rescued. We all have learned not to believe everything we read in a newspaper but on the other hand we trust everything that passes as news on TV; who would mistrust his own eyes? The average viewer does not ask himself, how the camera team always manages to be at the right place, at the right time. In our consumption-oriented society only one thing counts: how to realise an increase in sales and to get more consumers? Higher viewing figures guarantee more money. And we play the game and turn the TV on every day because we get what we want, and that is entertainment. We don't recognize that television does not satisfy our needs but only supplies superficialities and so we swallow it all .
What the drugs in our streets and the television have in common is their orientation towards consumption only. Marx would have been among the first to point this out, perhaps in a sentence similar to that in the title, but than he would have also replaced opium with crack .
