Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
It is of course always difficult to agree with assertions as categoric as this one. But we should perhaps first examine the aim of university studies before we discuss the statement in itself .
In my opinion, it would be a mistake to consider that university studies should prepare students for the "real world". One goes to university -I hope - because he is interested in a particular subject and wants to know more about it. He will of course learn things that he will never need in his professional career, but you expect from a mathematician that he knows how to calculate, even if he will rely on computers in his profession. Moreover, it is sometimes very difficult to know what your degree will lead you to do in life. Someone with a degree in general medicine might become a general practitioner or a researcher; or even change several times of job in the course of his life. Therefore, if one wants university to prepare him for the "real world", it should only learn him to be ambivalent. The problem is now to know if it is something one can learn .
As I suggested earlier, one shouldn't expect, when going to university, to learn how to behave in life the same way as a technician can learn how to deal with a machine. In fact the most significant thing I will have learned at my university is to do things by myself. But I will deal with this point later .
An important thing to mention here is that the average length of university studies in Belgium is of four years (even three in England). In such a short period of time, it is of course impossible to get all the knowledge one will need for the rest of his life. People who have already graduated have now to retrain. If a university cannot give to someone all the knowledge he needs, how on earth could it prepare him to deal with the complexity of the "real world"?
In fact I understand the word "university" as a place where one has to prove something. Of course, there are still teachers, but they are not as interested in pedagogy as secondary school teachers are. They give their lessons and it is for the students to show their ability to deal with the (most of of the time broad) subject. They have to show how they can assimilate the subject, but also how they can reorganize it, and think about it, and adapt themselves to every situation; in one word, how they can work by themselves. If they can do that, they are capable of holding a leading place in the society .
It is therefore that a university degree has a very good value and that they are praised everywhere. It is not only because you have learned something, but also because you can still learn something, because you can judge any situation rightly .
For all these reasons - and for one more - I strongly disagree with the statement I have just been discussing. My last reason is the following one: one may not consider a university degree only as a means to make money. A university is, above all, a place where you learn to think and to respect every opinion and every thing. This makes its value and the value of its degree .
