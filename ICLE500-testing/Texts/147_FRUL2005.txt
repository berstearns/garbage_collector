Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
In the 19th century, the time when Karl Marx lived, religion played an important role in our western world. Most people were brought up Christianely and their life was dominated by the church, which was at that time a very powerful organism. People accepted its rules without contradiction and believed all the priests said. Nobody dared to criticize them because they were respectable persons who knew how to deal with the people and how to keep them obedient .
Nowadays, the situation is completely different. Fundamental changes have taken place in the last hundred years, which had a negative effect on the power of the church. Although many people still believe in God, they are often opposed to the church as religious institution. They think that it is not at all adapted to our modern society and therefore, it becomes more criticized than ever before. It is regarded as old-fashioned because people can no longer identify with its opinions and its regulations. They do not need it any longer as leader through their life who tells them what is right and what is wrong, because they feel much more free, self-confident and independent than in the 19th century. If the church does not change its direction, it will loose all its credibility and most of its adherents. Today, there is unfortunately another power that slowly takes over the former role of the church: the television. Most people do not realize that it has a strong influence on them and that it determines their life .
Since the invention of television in the 1950ies, many technical improvements have been carried out. We enjoy colours and a number of programmes our ancestors never dreamed of. Several systems, like the cable TV and the Satellite TV, have been developed and make it possible to receive programmes from all over the world. There are different kinds of programmes: some only broadcast news, music, films or game-shows, others do a mixture of it. Many TV stations broadcast night and day so that people can watch television whenever they want. If they do not know what to do or if they are bored, they press the button and immediately have entertainment .
On first sight, the television seems to be a good and interesting invention. I think that it is, but only when people know to handle it correctly. At the beginning, it was something totally new and fascinating, people were happy when they could enjoy this luxury from time to time. Today, it has become something common. A television set is to be found in nearly all households, even the poorest, who often live in bad conditions, have one. Many people spend every day three to four before it. The problem is that they do not make in advance a selection of what they will watch. They simply switch on and watch everything without being critical about it. They become indifferent and begin to believe all they see, they take is as reality .
The television is in my eyes one of the greatest dangers that threatens our society. It is an invisible foe who creeps unconsciously into our life. It represents above all a danger for the children because they do not know how to judge what they have seen. If the parents do not control which TV-programme their children watch and if they do not speak with them about the broadcastings, it can have negative consequences. The children try for instance to imitate the film-heroes who, although brutal and violent, get glorified in the films. So, they do not understand or realize that they do something wrong when they copy the heroes' behaviour. There are also parents for whom the television is an easy way to keep their children quiet and to occupy them. I think that this is irresponsible, the children do not learn to play or to communicate with others. Later on, it will be difficult for them to lead a social and considerate life .
If the adults do not change their own TV-habits and those of their children, the world will still become more agressive, cold and indifferent .
