Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Journalists have got the privilege to select and bring something to the public eye. For reasons of time or space already, only a few out of all the incoming news can be chosen for publication. A reporter on television has thus to ask himself/herself which passage in a debate for example he/she will show the spectator and with which length. The credibility of television seems to be unshakeable, especially when the pictures are touching us emotionally. But in fact, they are always only a world looked at through the camera of a journalist. That means that nothing is more subjective than the objective of a camera. It is uncontestable that television has the nature of a model of living. Take the tragic incident that happened a few weeks ago, when the two [Illegible word/phrase] .
I once read that an American child, when having left school, has had about 11.000 hours of lessons but 22.000 hours of television with +/- 20.000 murders. I'm persuaded that television exerts an enormous pedagogical influence, unfortunatly no good one in general. But not only children are concerned. Adults also take television as an example for daily life. Take for instance the simple crime series like "Derrick" or "Tatort" on German television: the inspector is divorced, the families are ruined, the father has a mistress, the mother is drinking, the children are going their own ways. Religion, traditions, conventions only serve the caricature of bourgeois compulsions .
I'm sure that the "television-family" really exerts an influence on the domestic everyday life. We simply identify with it. No wonder that divorce and a bit on the side have become trivial offences. Often, I've got the impression that more and more people are living in a manipulated world of dreams and I fear that this is leading to a dulling in the face of reality, to a lack of creativity and that it may ruin the personality. Sure, the media and especially television open us best possibilities for both education and entertainment. Essential is just who decides what we can watch and why. We have to be careful, we have to consume critically so that we can uncover the attempted manipulation. The problem to my view is to cope with the whole host of information we get day in, day out. The danger is that we are virtually thankful that the media are thinking for us. In fact, they propagate what one thinks, feels, does. Here is birth given to the word "one" ("man" in German, "on" in French) which replaces individuality by generalization. Curiously enough, those media-makers, who consider themselves as critical, want a new enlightenment. They want us to emancipate from civil constraints, they want us to free ourselves from state, church or traditions. We shall come of age. But today, media and in particular television are becoming a means of remote control of the brain and prevent it from using itself independently. For me, one feature of maturity is actually the ability of independent thinking. So, don't we let television become the opium of the 20th century masses so that we can preserve a critical common sense .
