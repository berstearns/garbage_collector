Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
In a century in which many traditional values and ideals are doubted or even turned over it is no wonder that also the male supremacy which for a long time dominated the relationship between men and women isn't spared questionning .
Surely, it cannot be denied that some feminists seem to push their demands too far but one shouldn't forget the original ideas behind this movement. Women want to point at the male predominance stretching itself over many fields of society starting from women's treatment at their working place and going on to the language obviously based on male supremacy if one comes to think about it. In the first place feminists just wanted to draw attention to the fact that women no longer agree with the traditional role they have to play in society and that it's high time to review all our old-fashioned preconceived ideas about women. In this respect one cannot deny them a certain success. They obviously managed to bring about a revolution in the perception of the relation between men and women be it at home, in the streets or at work. But things are not that easy .
One problem is that feminists should pay attention not to switch over to another extreme of female supremacy and to substitute one absolute value for another. Their sometimes too strict claims may be the reason why some people simply turn their back on feminism and content themselves ridiculing it. Still, to reject women's claims of more rights and greater independance as complete nonsense because they are radical is a far too easy way out. Thereby one avoids questionning one's old-established world-view and completely misses the point of feminism .
Moreover it is perhaps worth noticing that by their strictness fierce feminists are not just attracting opponents among men but also among women themselves. Not all women wish for a complete equality with men and reject their traditional role of "housewives" as out-dated. Through feminism women, too, are forced to reconsider their function in society and some may have realized that they don't really object to the traditional part they play and don't wish for a change at all .
Another problem is that feminists or reactionnary movements in general don't always take into account that some time has to pass before the change in the people's mind has taken place. They want a change here and now. They forget that their claims involve a reconsideration of the basic structure of society. They should show themselves more patient about the results of their claims, action cannot be taken without delay in all fields. If they would give society some more time to think about their ideas and to change progressively their cause would stand in a better light .
To sum up I think that although some feminists may push the idea of women's liberation too far, their initiative brought the perception of women in nowadays society into the center of discussion and made a deeper understanding of women's situation possible. Even though one may not agree with their claims they managed to force society to reconsider its values and especially the role women play. Therefore I'd like to conclude that feminists have done more good than harm to the cause of women .
