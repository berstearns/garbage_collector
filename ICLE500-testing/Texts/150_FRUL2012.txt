Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 
 
In his novel Animal Farm, Orwell satirizes communism. And the nowadays famous sentence "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others." actually criticizes the communists' claim to be able to guarantee equal treatment of all people. Whereas even in communism, leaders are necessary, that is some superiors who due to their function have more power than others and some privileges .
If one looks more carefully at the different domains of everyday life, such as politics, religion, family or work, one will discover that whenever several people form a unit, some kind of organization is necessary and in most cases a hierarchical system will be chosen. Hierarchy involves different ranks or positions, that is a difference in importance and in power, those at the top being the most important and the most powerful people. The hierarchical organization is often compared to a pyramid, which indicates taht there are only few at the top but many at the bottom of such a group .
A lot of political and religious systems as well as other forms of organizations such as the army or the school system illustrate Orwell's observation. It reflects the widely held opinion that all people are born equal, that is with the same rights but that in the course of their life, as everybody is free to become what they want to, the fittest being those who combine strength and fighting spirit will reach superior positions. Communism aimed at overcoming Darwinism and tried to equal out the difference between the strong and the weak by treating everybody equally. But the well-meant concept didn't work. The communists finally had to acknowledge that the interaction of strong and weak, of superior and inferior is necessary for the survival of the whole group. That is that people need variation and some stimulant so that they can be productive and creative. Nowadays the formerly communist Easteuropean countries tend to adopt the capitalistic and democratic system of Western nations. Both market economy and elections enable those who want to move up the scale to do so. The link between politics and economy is underlined by the fact that the state provides for the socially weak by giving them part of the affluent's welfare, thus also aiming at equal opportunities for everybody, which obviously aren't provided by nature. In economics, the difference between the strong and the weak is defined in terms of the rich and the poor or in terms of the managing director and the simple worker, standing at the opposite ends of the same scale. In politics, the difference between those at the top and those at the bottom is expressed in terms of the leaders in power making the decisions and the masses, the so-called subjects or underlings .
Moreover, the hierarchical distinction between the superior and the inferior can also be applied to the sexes. Most societies are patriarchies. In those communities, men have all or most of the power and importance. Men are the masters and women the servants. Feminism tried to put an end to this and has so far achieved some success. Nowadays, at least in most Western countries, men and women are paid the same salary for the same job, young women may study and work in typically man's professions and trades as well as vote and wear trousers, etc. Things that weren't yet taken for granted by our great-grand-mothers. However, the emancipation of women hasn't been by any means completed .
Another crucial distinction between privileged and disadvantaged people concerns the relationship between the races. In some, especially Asian and African countries, slavery being the total denial of equality still exists. Favouring the white race, in South Africa apartheid and in the United States until very recently segregation separates/separated races. In other nations, a more subtle form of racism, of disapproval for others is used. People are treated as inferior because they belong to a particular race. Especially in the Western world, racism has become a big problem because these regions are overcrowded and governments have difficulty in providing equal opportunities for everybody. In search for a scapegoat, people often turn to foreigners in their country .
To sum up, one can say that Orwell's statement "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others." is still true, since living together in large groups seems to require a hierarchical system. Even in a very democratic community, there will be some chief, no matter whether he/she is at the top due to his/her strength and ability, sex or race .
