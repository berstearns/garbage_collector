Title: In the 19th century, Victor Hugo said: 'How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed.' Do you think it is still true nowadays?
 
Victor Hugo's sentence [Quotation] shows that he must have been an early ecologist. In fact, the 19th century was the century of industrialization and was marked by the pursuit of maximal profit. In this pursuit man and nature had no place at all. Probably Victor Hugo clearly perceived this situation .
What Victor Hugo said in the 19th century is still true for the 20th century and even more so. Yet if we had to paraphrase his sentence, we would probably say that [Quotation] . The awareness that man is part of nature goes back to the 1960's, at the time of man's first journeys in space. At that moment astronauts from different missions clearly perceived the earth as being a closed system, like a deserted island lost in the middle of an ocean, and therefore they saw it as a fragile system that needs a strict managment in order to avoid an ecological desaster, in order to save it .
Bit by bit this idea has gained ground. Thus in the 1970's we see the birth of many ecological movements. Little by little the "calling out of nature" has reached some ears and man is trying to find an appropriate solution. The more man interferes with nature in a careless way, the more he seeks assurance that somewhere it is beyond his responsibility. Now man's longing expresses itself in catalogues full of "back-to-nature" remarks and in the popularity of films like "Dances with the Wolves" or "Le Grand Bleu". There is a longing to return to a healthier life. Now people dream of what life was like before industrialization .
But now we may wonder whether it is not already too late: the oceans die, rivers and sees are polluted by runoff from industrial plans and by spills from tankers and ships, the atmosphere is getting warmer with the greenhouse effect, certain species of animals are endangered, non-recyclable material waste increase every day and our forests are attacked by acid rain. In short, nature is in danger, we are in danger and the situation requires a quick reaction. Our leaders should come to an agreement in order to set up a special program that would be really efficient. But unfortunatly economical interests come first, they come before mankind's general interest .
It is possible that it is already too late, even if nature absorbs many of our attacks. It is probable that we have gone too far. Except for the ecologists, none of the decision-making people (politicians, industrialists, ...) seem to be willing to do something that goes against this auto-destructive tendenc . We can think that if Victor Hugo's sentence had affected his contemporaries, we would probably not have this situation today. But now we have no choice, we have to fight in order to leave our children on environment fit to live in .
