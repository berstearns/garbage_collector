Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
As the knight in Chaucer's [Reference] has to discover what women most desire, we could ask ourselves: what does Man most covet? In the light of many episodes in history we could say that greed, the need of possession, gives to many people great impetus in life .
One of the underlying principles in our society, like in many others, is the exchange between individuals. From the beginning human beings have exchanged things they had against what they did not have. In this way the more currency you have, the more likely you are to get all you want, to be in power and have the others under your dependence. Who would not want to have much money, who would not want to make profit? This is in fact the basis of trade. Tradesmen are mainly concerned in increasing their takings, that is why they raise their prices and pay their personnel as cheap as possible. What is the use of traffic in drugs and hold-ups if not to get this means of exchange called money? Money, the magic word .
Any world where all would be free and anybody would be disinterested is pure utopia. Life would yet be so easy if each of us could content oneself with the necessary and was not eager on getting the superfluous. Few people are satisfied with what they have. This justifies naturally the success of all these games where you can win money and, on another level, this is also why we witness so many aggressions, burglaries, traffics, corruptions,... Excess is what harms our society but does the society itself not prompt its citizens to spend much money and even more than they have? All over in the streets advertisements encourage the consumer to buy a beautiful new car, to fly to the tropical islands for the holidays or to have absolutely the latest CD or video player. All seems so easy, if you do not have the money now you may well ask for a bank loan. The average man wonders then why he could not enjoy all these goods too .
Money or any kind of currency is thus a necessary instrument in trade but can it be a valuable argument to wage war on a country or on someone and destroy so many innocent lives? Why did the Americans intervene so quickly in the Gulf War if not because they had interests to protect? This is not of course the main reason but the losses of oil could have been disastrous for the US economy. Why do so many families quarrel when they have to share a legacy if not because one member of the family gets or wants more than the others?
Actually very few people like money for money's sake, most of them are desirous of the luxuriousness it may bring. As long as this does not lead to an obsession, anyone may dream of getting more, but once you are ready to make sacrifices in order to get all you want, there must be something wrong. Is money worth destroying friendship, love or even life? It is often asserted that "money is the root of all evil" but I think it would be more accurate to say that eagerness is the root of all evil and money only one aspect of it .
