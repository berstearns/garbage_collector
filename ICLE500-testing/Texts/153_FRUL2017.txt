Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Marx claimed that religion was "the opium of the masses". Did he mean by this that the church provided people with some drugs? Not exactly, what he did mean is that religion has always been a good way of keeping people under some control. Until the Modern Ages most of the people were illiterate, and they didn't have the opportunity to study, so that only the clergy had some knowledge which made it possible for them to spread the Truth among the masses. So people never developed any critical mind which would have enabled them to question the authority. It was all the easier for the Church to manipulate those people who were so accustomed to following the rules that they wouldn't have even thought of debating them .
They were under the influence of a drug which annihilated the functions of the human brain .
In our society religion doesn't play such a role any more, but we may wonder to what extent television does play a similar function today...
To begin with, it seems clear to me that from time immemorial people have needed some diversions. The legal authorities of a country have always seen in those distractions a good way of keeping the masses away from interfering too much in state matters. So did the Romans emperors for instance provide people with all that they most wanted -"panem et cicenses", bread and circus games - in order to keep them away from questioning policy .
Nowadays television turns out to play the same role as those ancient games: this is why we may now speak of the stupefying effect of television on the masses. In other words, television is a kind of drug which keeps peole in lethargy, and it prevents them from developing a sharp critical taste .
This is mainly due to the bad quality of the programmes that are broadcast by the different TV-channels, which don't aim at enhancing the intellectual level of the audience, but rather at attracting the largest possible audience. Therefore, most TV programmes at peak hours will consist of game shows, soap operas, American series, or other sensational "reality shows"...
In this respect, it is obvious that governments have some control over the making of those programmes. Governments grant money to the national TV channels and they exert censorship. They see to it that television is used as a sleeping drug or as a means of influencing the TV-watcher .
Recent historical events such as the Gulf-war or the Rumanian "revolution" have clearly illustrated the importance of television as a means of propaganda .
At the beginning of the "Gulf-crisis" most Americans were unlike their government against any armed intervention of their country in Kuwait. The Bush Administration, in order to have those recalcitrants on its side, didn't hesitate to make up terrifying stories about what was supposed to have taken place in Iraq. American TV-channels also broadcast a series of programmes about the way Iraqi soldiers took newborn children off the hands of their mothers in order to build up their army .
All this information, which soon turned out to have been invented, had such an horrifying effect on the American audience that nothing could prevent the USA from sending troops to the Gulf...
A few months before, the Rumanian dissenters had roused the indignation of Western countries by broadcasting very moving programmes about the atrocities which were supposed to have taken place in Timisoara, these later proved to be false .
Another negative aspect of television is the effect it can have on people, especially on children .
Indeed, television creates an illusionary world in which children believe because it is all the more difficult for them to make a clear distinction between fiction and reality .
The recent tragedy in Liverpool has once more drawn our attention to the delicate issue of the influence of television on a child's behaviour. Is television responsible for the rising violence among children?
There is no absolute certainty about this. Some sociologists argue that television has a cathartic effect on people. In that case, it would be an outlet for some emotions rather than the cause of a rising violence .
I don't agree with those sociologists, because I keep thinking that television causes violence rather than discouraging it. Furthermore, I am deeply convinced that parents should be more careful as regards the education of their children. They should try to put an end to the hegemony of television, by finding a substitute for it .
