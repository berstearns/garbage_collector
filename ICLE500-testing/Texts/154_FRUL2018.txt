Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Not only Great Britain but the whole Western world was shocked by the events that took place in a little town in England: two ten-year-old boys kidnapped a two-year-old child, beat it to death, and threw it on the rails near their home. Everybody asked the same question: Why did they do this? What causes a ten-year-old boy to act in such a cruel way?
But the second question people asked was: What happens next? How are the boys going to be judged?
It is fixed in the British law that every person who has reached the age of ten is responsible for his acts. This would mean that the boys will be judged and punished like murderers, they will be sentenced to prison for life. But is this punishment really the right thing to do?
Sociologists and psychologists are more and more questioning our prison system that they call outdated and uneffective. For many young people the way of becoming a criminal is a very short one. Our society is not as stable as it has been a generation ago. After the two wars there was an upward movement throughout Europe. Industries were flourishing, technology was developing, and people were optimistically looking towards a good future. But nowadays optimism is a mentality completely strange to the biggest part of the younger generation. What frightens them are problems like unemployment, ecocide, AIDS, and the future itself. Normal consequences of these fears are drug-abuse, rejection of the values or advices of the elder generation, and the strong desire to find a community of like-minded people. Mainly in bigger cities the streets often become home for many young persons. But the law of the street is not an easy one. You have to fight for your life. If you are given no chance of earning your living in an honest way you steal the money you need or prostitute yourself to survive. And there he is the criminal of our days. When the law court judges these criminals and when they are put into prison things are getting worse: the law of the street is a hard one but the laws in prison are still harder and only the strongest survives. The problem in prison is that the prisoners are forced to live together on a very small space. This creates aggressions they cannot get rid of. The life in prison engraves on the convict's mind so that he is not able to live a normal life again after his release. He realizes that he will not get the help from society to reaccustom to a normal life: the vicious circle is closed .
There are services of rehabilitation for prisoners but why not rehabilitate them before they are completely spoiled in prison. Detension is not the right solution to the problem. We are dealing with a social problem and not with many different individual ones. Criminality is a product of our society and we should give criminals a chance to see that there are other ways of mastering their lives. A so-called civilised society should live with its weak members and not against them. Because a chain is only as strong as its weakest link .
