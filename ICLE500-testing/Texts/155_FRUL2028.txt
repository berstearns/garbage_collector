Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
If I were to respond spontaneously to this essay's title, I would say that this statement is certainly a male one. But on reflection, I consider that we should be cautious about making over-simplified assertions and try to consider the emancipation issue from a more prismatic point of view, which is not an easy undertaking .
According to [Reference] emancipation is [Quotation] . The notion of emancipation implies that of equality and, considered under that angle, we are far away from the emancipated human being the Western world claims as one of its great achievements. In my opinion, it would be wrong to denigrate the enormous task accomplished by feminists such as, for example, the British suffragettes. Who could forget that in the 19th century many male citizens were legally allowed to beat their wife, that women were not admitted to universities or that they were denied the right to vote?
But in the following lines, I will try to give a quick outline of what I consider as being important aspects of the emancipation issue .
As I see it, the question of emancipation is at its very essence an economic one. Women now have the opportunity to work outside their home which means that they can earn their own living and no longer depend economically on their husband .
Some may argue that women now have a lot more to do than in earlier days, that they must try to combine the work outside with that inside their home. But if a woman's partner does not help her with the "homework", she now has the choice either to die in harness or to revolt and possibly leave him. But many so-called "liberated" women abuse of their power and it is a shame that they seem to think that now it is their turn to oppress others .
In many areas of life, our social and financial situation determinates the way in which we will be treated. Let us only take the example of medecine and law: the most competent medical specialists and lawyers are often reserved to the rich. But not only the financial situation may be an obstacle in a person's life: in our bureaucratic society, where law is supposed to be accessible to all, you need a certain educational background in order to manage to obtain what is considered to be your rights .
What are the most important rights a society should offer to its population? In my view, the right to work is one of them. A job gives you financial independence and the sense to contribute towards a function of our society which could be satisfactory for all its members .
It is a pity that more and more people fear for their job or find themselves shunted to one side. In order to safe money many jobs are sacrified, which in the long run will only amplify our problematic situation .
These reflections lead me to consider our political world. Are we equal politically?
No, we are not. The best proof of this affirmation is the fact that we are ruled by people who benefit from the regime of parliamentary privilege and enjoy many other extra advantages. Our politicians seldom remain loyal and honest once they are in power, and their politics are very often far away from the real needs of the community .
The gap between the most and the least favoured classes is widening, and it is tragic that those who rule us belong most often to the favoured classes or have to deny their original ideas if they want to survive in the political world. Those people, even if they are elected by our democratic system (which is far from being perfect) are simply out of touch with the problems faced by less fortunate members of our society .
Moving towards an increasingly egocentric society with growing unemployment, racism, juvenile criminality and drug-abuses the crucial issue is that of the achievement of a real emancipation for every human being, whatever his or her gender, age or social and cultural background .
