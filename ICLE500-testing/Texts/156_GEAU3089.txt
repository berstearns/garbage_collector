Title: A defence of capital punishment

In what are known as the bad and cruel old days of the dark and dismal Middle Ages, we are led to believe that a bloodthirsty hangman with a black hood on his head and a huge axe in his hand was doing his job in almost every country of the known world. Not only did he execute, however, criminals or murderers. The victims slaughtered at the stake or on the scaffold came from all walks of life: from beggar to best man, from lawyer to lecturer, from queen to dairymaid, from king to knight, from witch to whore. It would have been very easy to sentence somebody to death without a real reason. It were mostly churchmen and feudal lords who abused capital punishment as an instrument of political power in order to reach their ambitious aims .
Nowadays, however, we are far from the despotism of the Middle Ages. The system of arbitrarily sentencing somebody to death has long since been abandoned in favour of fair and legal proceedings. Instead of beheading the prisoner after having blackmailed his confession it takes the prosecution a long time, many proofs and bodies of evidence to convince the jury of somebody's guilt. This system, which is still in use in the U.S., Asia and some European countries, has the great merit of being fairer and juster. The court of justice has to take over an enormous responsibility when they charge a criminal with death. The question is: Is capital punishment still a justified and suitable punishment for convicted criminals?
The answer depends on the crime itself. Of course it is not necessary to finish somebody off because of shop-lifting, kidnapping or extortion. If, however, the accused is a convicted murderer, terrorist or a women's nightmare, which means a sexual offender, we shouldn't keep and feed and breed him in prison at the expense of the tax-payer. It is unfortunately inevitable to sentence these criminals to death .
Some people disagree with this. A few considering themselves as modern, fair and human and in violent reaction against capital punishment, maintain that this kind of punishing is cruel and antiquated and has to be abandoned. They fight for humanity and regard capital punishment as a violation of human rights. But, why should we defend or even spare culprits of bestial and beastly crimes? They wouldn't respect human rights at all! They murder and kill and rape and are a menace to all people. Killing innocend people doesn't deserve anything better than capital punishment! An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth!
Other people have what appears to be a better reason against capital punishment. They say that this punishment doesn't act as a measure of deterrent. If you have a look at the U.S., they say you will have to notice that although capital punishment has been imposed for convicted criminals the number of committed crimes is still rising. The argument against this point is that the danger of being sentenced to death will prevent first offenders from committing a crime. Persistent offenders like mass murderers, however, are at least done in. They can't go on killing and raping people after a couple of years in prison. It is life and limb of former and potential victims which has to be respected and protected as careful as possible .
