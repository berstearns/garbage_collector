Title: Argue the case for or against capital punishment 

"Therefore I sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you are dead!" This sentence was the end of the trial, but for him it was the beginning - the beginning of the last few days of his life. He was twenty-six years old, in the prime of his life, but all that remained were four days, four days of waiting, dreading what lay before him. Then finally at 8 o'clock in the morning that solitary walk to the gallow. A young body, an active mind, a life to be cut down before its time. The hood over his head, the noose around his neck - still a human being, shivering with fright, panting heavily. At last a click and the trapdoor swings open. The man has fallen three feet when the noose grips, crushing his neck and strangling his windpipe. The muscular spasm of the rectum and the bladder robs the corpse of its last human trait - dignity .
This scene, which is not uncommon in some parts of the world, might well happen again in our country. The call for the reintroduction of capital punishment has increased immensely during the last few years. It seems to be the ultimate weapon against the rise of crime, the nuclear deterrent of punishment. Most people who argue pro capital punishment, however, overlook the fact that the threat of losing their life does not deter people from committing crimes, quite the opposite in fact. Those states of the US which re-introduced the death sentence did not succeed in decreasing the crime rate, which is at least en par with states without capital punishment, if not even higher. Japan has, amid much protest from Amnesty International, recently executed several prisoners after suspending the execution for several years. Again there is no evidence that links crime statistics with the threat of capital punishment. There is of course an argument for the death sentence, which cannot easily be disputed. One could say that if a member of the human race commits an atrocious crime, say the wilful murder of another human, he or she has forfeited the right to live. In this case the taking of that life would not be a deterrent for others or revenge, but simply a penalty, the ultimate exclusion from the community of humans. This is a view a lot of early cultures took .
There is, however, one flaw in that argument. This flaw lead to the abolition of the death-penalty in Great Britain (+) in the fifties. It is not always possible to establish whether the accused is actually guilty of the crime he is supposed to have committed. The last person hanged in England was found guilty by the jury on the basis of evidence, although he always maintained his innocence. A few months after his death it was indeed proven that the wrong person was killed. The ensuing public outcry and debate finally lead to the abolition of capital punishment. It did not however bring the unfortunate victim back to life .
In my view there is no justification in capital punishment, if there is the slightest chance of wrongful sentence. If only one in a million were hanged although innocent, the death-penalty as a whole would be wrong. It is not in our power to judge correctly all the time, but we cannot correct a death-sentence once executed .
(+) FN: To say that Britain has abolished capital punishment is not entirely correct. There is still a law that decrees that anyone who murders a member of the royal family can be sentenced to death .
