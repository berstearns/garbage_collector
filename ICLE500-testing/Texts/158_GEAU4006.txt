Title: Argue the case for or against capital punishment 

"From a hopeful to a has been to a front runner to a superstar." This is a favourable portrayal of the new U.S. President Bill Clinton that could be found in this week's TIME magazine [Feb . 1]. This man, the most powerful and most influential politician on earth, is momentarily worshipped by the whole American nation. However, he governs a country where abortion and capital punishment (that means guilty people sentenced to death by hanging, electric chair or gas-chamber where the human being experiences gruesome pain by slow asphyxiation) are legal means of shortening human existences .
Due to statistics there are more than 650 innocent women and children raped or tortured in Germany per year. These poor, frail creatures will be physically and psychically marked for the rest of their lives. A considerable percentage of those despaired victims even tries to commit suicide. But how are the tormentors prosecuted?
Can you still remember media reports in 1977 when two children of the wealthy Oetker family were kidnapped? They were brutally arrested in a small box hidden in a wooded area. After a short time they died because of a lack of air for breath. But what was the childrens' guilt? They had to suffocate horribly just for monetary reasons!
Two years ago the chairman of the Deutsche Bank, Mr. Herrhausen was assassinated when his car was blown up by a bomb. An important position had been his death sentence. But what will happen to the RAF terrorists who signed responsible for that tremendous crime? Have we got to go back again to murder prosecution with the help of capital punishment? Isn't there a true biblical quotation that goes like "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"? Or the common vendetta slogan "a life for a life". That means that murder must be revenged by the execution of the killer?
But it can't be a fitting measure to end people's life by a decision of a law court. For, originally, there is the good in every creature. It only depends how and where children are brought up. And this is a reason for the fact that many human beings develop differently and sometimes commit crimes. Society has to help those helpless creatures and cure them if possible .
Life was given by God. The human existence is a miraculously divine gift. And every person has its individual destiny with which it has to cope as far as possible. God gives life and takes it. That means that only our creator can end our existence. So, nobody can murder another person whether it be a beggar or a judge .
For me, abortion, euthanasia (when you help a person to die) and even capital punishment are illegal ways of killing. And not to speak of suicide because we're not allowed to leave our destiny if God doesn't finish it .
