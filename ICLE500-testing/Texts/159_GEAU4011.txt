Title: Why should anyone study foreign languages?

You can hear it everywhere and from everybody that, today, studying foreign languages is almost compulsory. It can be of direct use to the learner when he or she goes abroad. And reasons for going abroad are numerous nowadays. It is not only a matter of having fun and going on holiday. If we take into account the situation of the European Community there is no denying the fact that the use of foreign languages can become important in your job situation. It might even be just the extra qualification you need to get a job at all .
Imagine yourself being sent to an international congress in the U.S. on behalf of your company. You are expected to return with detailed information on the latest development on the international market. You may still feel quite comfortable with the American congress. Usually one can gather the gist of the lectures with what you remember of your English learnt in school. Yet being sent to France could already be more of a risk, since they will most probably stick to French there, as the French are known for showing little inclination to giving up their mother tongue .
Of course, studying foreign languages is not all about jobs and career. Being on holiday travelling through a remote, sleepy village in the Tatra mountains in Slovakia or passing through an old, rustic wine-growing estate at the foot of wavy hills patched with green and ochre, sun-burnt vines in the south of France, you will feel so much closer to the natives and the country when you are able to ask your way around or even have a chat with them. Communication in a foreign country enhances the intercultural aspect of your holidays considerably .
I know what I am talking about. I had been doing English for eight years at school and for three more years at university when I decided to spend a couple of weeks travelling round Britain and Ireland, spending a sort of educational holiday there to brush up my geographic and cultural knowledge of it. I started the tour in a small, yet picturesque and lively little seaside resort right at the coast of Northern Ireland. It was the first evening of my holidays and I was keen on getting to know people, talking to native speakers. I was out for the authentic kind of information these people were supposed to be able to deliver as recommended over and over again by teachers and lecturers at home .
In eager anticipation I went to the local pub. As I had hoped I met people very quickly. They were very friendly. At least I could tell that from their behaviour. I could not tell it from what they were saying though, because I did not understand a word. The first man I talked to was the pub owner behind the bar. He was an old man lacking some teeth and mumbling terribly. I thought, "well, too bad, but I would probably have difficulties understanding him in my own language...". Yet I had but little less problems understanding "average" speakers .
This only started to improve after three or four weeks when I had got used to the peculiarities of different accents and dialects. Only then could I start to talk to people without asking them three times to repeat what they had just said, which really makes natural and relaxed conversation impossible. So I would still recommend that studying foreign languages is a nice and noble thing to do; but do not expect it to be of too much direct use when you go abroad!
