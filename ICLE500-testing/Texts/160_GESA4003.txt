Title: Should the death penalty be abolished? 
 
At the beginning I want to make clear that in my opinion there does not exist an appropriate sentence for a crime because the circumstances and the psychological state of mind of the perpetrator are always different. Therefore the death penalty should also be abolished in those countries where it is still practised .
In my opinion nobody has the right to kill a person in order to take revenge or because of any other reason. It goes without saying that every person who commits a crime has to be punished, because otherwise the legal system of a state would be questioned and the public security would no longer be guaranteed .
To my mind not even the members of the Supreme Court have the right to impose the death penalty on a criminal, because also they cannot pass an absolutely unfailing judgement whether the perpetrator is guilty or not. No matter how many pieces of evidence prove the guilt of a criminal, I think there always remain doubts and a feeling of uncertainty .
Already in the Bible it is written that you should not give tit for tat because that does not lead to a solution. The supporters of the death penalty should point out to themselves that it is no solution to kill a criminal because he killed somebody. It is far more important to help the criminal and to search for the reason why such atrocities are carried out in our modern society .
My point of view is that everybody should get a second chance no matter what he had done. Also criminals should have the possibility to integrate themselves again in the society povided that they have realized the incorrectness of their actions and are willing to mend their ways .
There are several kinds of crimes but in my opinion the most important distinction is to be made between terrorist killings and other crimes. Terrorist killings are generally committed by several people who get their instructions by a kind of leader who plans the action. The nature of terrorism is that a certain number of people fight for a certain idea or for their beliefs. IF some people of their group are imprisoned they, for example, hijack an aeroplane to get them free again. Terrorists know how to attract people's attention and which actions they must set to be successful, because if innocent human beings are involved the government of a state must react very quickly, because the lives of human beings cannot be risked. I think that not all politically-motivated violence is terrorism because many political assassinations are committed by perpetrators who are no terrorists .
Additionally it is necessary to distinguish between violence carried out by the state and violence carried out by individuals. Both kinds of violence have to be judged differently because violence carried out by the state often causes full-scale ruptures in the fabric of society and violence carried out by individuals do mostly not attack the system of society in that violent way. The distinction I have made is a rather rough one but I wanted to point out how many different kinds of crimes do exist and how variable their reasons and consequences are. Therefore I cannot imagine that anyone presumes to pass the judgement of death penalty on a criminal. I am sure that already also a few innocent people had been killed although the judges had several pieces of evidence to prove their guilt .
I hope that soon the supporters of the death penalty realize that it is no solution to kill criminals but to improve the structure of our modern society which is the reason for all atrocities which are committed. In most cases a crime is comitted because the perpetrators want to attract attention because they are at loss what to do. Therefore they should not be killed but helped out of their difficulties .
