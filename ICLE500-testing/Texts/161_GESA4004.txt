Title: Should the death penalty be abolished? 
 
 [Quotation] [Reference] . This definition does clarify the meaning of the phrase "capital punishment" but it does not provide any justification for the use of the death penalty. It seems to me that asking "what" capital punishment is is not as important as the question "why" it is still in use. In many countries all over the world hell is still being raised over the controversial question whether death penalty should be abolished or not .
Some religious faiths are based on the bible or at least on parts of it. Many people consider themselves to be true believers, so why should they not live by the laws of the book of books? Why should they not [Quotation] [Reference] ? And why should they not abide by the biblical law, [Quotation] ? [Reference] Many western European societies seem to have realized that the texts of the bible are outdated. Since the age of the Enlightenment the death sentence has been highly critizised. Although this kind of punishment was controversial since the 18th century, many countries abolished the death sentence only a few years ago. The Federal Republic of Germany for example abolished capital punishment in 1949 whereas former East Germany used this kind of punishment up to the reunion of east and west in 1989. The Austrian government, which used to carry out the death sentences by hanging, decided in 1919 not to use death penalty anymore. So did Switzerland in 1937. France, which had many spectacular beheadings, only abolished the death penalty in 1981. The United States government also decided to abolish death penalty in 1972, but unfortunately, some states of the Union reestablished capital punishment in 1976 and still use it today (cf. Brockhuas) 1961 the British lawyer Peter Benenson founded Amnesty International (ai). The organization aims to help prisoners who were arrested for religious, racial or ethical reasons, provided they did not approve of or use violence. Every year ai members plead for the release of about 5000 prisoners. The organization holds conferences and initiates actions against the violation of human rights. There is a high demand for organizations like ai as the high number of executions in 1984 sadly documents . 1125 verifiable executions in 44 countries worldwide seem to be a cry for help. ai was awarded the Nobel peach price in 1977. (cf. Fischer Weltalmanach 1988).
The Afro-American Edward Earl Johnson was sentenced to death by a jury in Louisiana for murdering a white women. The verdict was based only on the statement which Johnson had given under the pressure of policemen forcing him to repeat their words at pistol point. Although his family and his lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court several times, Edward E. Johnson was executed in the early eighties after spending only a comparatively short period of time on death row. According to Amnesty International, Mr Johnson is the 24th innocent individual since 1961 who was executed .
In the United States there is a steady increase in the number of criminal actions. Therefore the need for solutions is crucial. The President of the country, Bill Clinton, and his staff developed a bill which is currently discussed in congress. Besides employing an additional number of policemen Bill Clinton proposes that the death penalty should be reestablished for another 47 crimes. Apparently Bill Clinton concludes that a greater number of executions will act as a deterent for other criminals. Of course, the intensification of the death penalty will not be the only novelty. The new bill on gun purchase seems to have far more potential of being effective. The authors of this bill suggest that there should be a five day interval between the application for a weapon and the actual receipt of the gun. In those five days police could inquire about the potential purchaser. But it will not be easy to make this bill a law because the gun lobby is very powerful in the United States .
In the United States crime is beyond the point where it can be controlled by police. State penitentiaries are overcrowded and there are no social programms which help to keep the youngsters of the streets. Statistics say that the number of 14-17 year old murderers has increased by 124% from 1986-1991. Teenagers experience so much violence on the streets that the thought of dying does not really frighten them anymore. The death sentence therefore loses its purpose, if it ever had one .
