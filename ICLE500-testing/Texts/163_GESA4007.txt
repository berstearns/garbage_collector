Title: Do you think that the death penalty should be abolished? 
 
In my opinion, the death penalty should be abolished - the sooner, the better. I cannot believe that this kind of punishment is still tolerated in our - like everybody thinks - modern society. Especially in the USA convicted men and woman are killed by death injections, on the electric chair or in gas chambres, even today. The most illogical thing for me is, that a murderer is condemned to death in one American state and in another he is not .
Now, the question is, why only so few people protest against this punishment, on the contrairy, some citizens even switch on their TV to see, how a convicted person is killed! SO, these people seem to be for the death penalty, but what are their reasons?
I think very important for their opinion is the propaganda by politicians. They often tell us that the death penalty serves as a deterrent. In my opinion this is totally wrong. Every criminal just thinks that he will never be caught and so most of them do not even think of a sentencing in the moment of the criminal act. Anyway, in the Soviet Union, the death penalty has already been abolished, but the crime rate is lower than in the US neverthenless. So, this punishment has nothing to do with deterrent .
Even the worth thing is that the convicted people mostly have to wait for years until they are killed and have no idea when. They cannot "survive psychically" if every day could be their last. However, what about the miscarriages of justice? It already happened that innocents have been killed in the name of right and justice. Our guilty conscience can't bring them back to life again!
Just generally spoken: I think that noone has the right to kill anybody, no matter, if the convicted person is a murderer or not. We are living in the twentiest century and the death penalty really reminds me of the time of Hammurabi .
Of course, it is always dangerous that a captive flees, but also that an innocent is killed. And who wants to be responsible for that?
Another reason for the absolition of the death penalty is of course the brutallity of the murderer. If we just think of the electric chair. Sometimes it even lasts ten! minutes until the condemned person is dead. Isn't this a real torture?
The best thing would be that everybody who is affected by the death penalty, can decide for himself, if he wants to be life imprisonment or if he prefers to die soon and fast. But therefore, new possibilities for the chosen liquidation must be found, which the victims are murdered painlessly .
