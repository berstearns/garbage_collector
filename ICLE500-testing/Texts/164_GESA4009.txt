Title: Do you think that the death penalty should be abolished? 
 
In many countries of the world, even in some states of the U.S.A., death penalty is a common method to punish murderers or other criminals who have done a really bad crime. But it is also known that such methods of punishment are like those people used already thousands of years ago. Is it allright then, that in such highly civilized countries, as the United States, death penalty is still used?
One can understand that the relatives of a person who has been brutally murdered want revenge. The majority of people feel that to the person who has committed such a crime, as a murder, should happen the same. Especially when there has been a mass murder many people have the feeling that the person having done this should be killed too. I think that one can understand such feelings very well .
Another reason why many people are not against the death penalty is that they think that the death of a delinquent is going to frighten other criminals. It is a common opinion that if criminals are punished very hard there will be less crimes. Therefore the death penalty is also considered to be a deterrent for other criminals .
Besides society feels much better when it is known that a criminal cannot do harm anymore. When a murderer is punished to death people are sure that he cannot commit murder again. Therefore society feels safer when criminals, especially murderers, are also killed .
On the other hand there are other possibilities to protect the society from criminals. In many countries, for instance, murderers are imprisoned for the rest of their lives. There is just a very slight chance that a deliquent is able to break out of a prison and commit crimes again. Therefore prisons can very well keep criminals away from the rest of the society. Besides it is had enough for a person to spend the rest of his life in prison .
There would be also possibilities to have something like revenge, when people are imprisoned. Criminals, especially murderers should have to work hard for the rest of their lives. With their work they should help those who had suffered most from their crimes. Or the money which is raised by this work should be given to family members of a killed person. One can say that such means do not bring the dead to life again, but killing the one who committed the crime does not do it either. By having to work a criminal at least has to try to repare the harm he has done to someone and it is probably the only way to better the situation. And as I said killing a person for having murdered someone does not change anything .
My personal opinion is that no person has the right to judge wether a person should live or not. Not even when he has done a very bad crime. Besides one has to give everyone a chance to change and to better. There have been interviews with persons short before they were going to be executed. Some of these interviews are deeply mooving, because it seems that some of the deliqents regret their deeds and seem to have changed. Therefore I think, that people do not have the right to judge wether a person should be punished with death or not .
I feel very sorry that highly civilized countries still do not have other means than death penalty in order to deal with criminals, especially with murderes. This is indeed the easiest way to handle crimes. But I do not think that this is the only and best way .
I am convinced that there are other methods of punishment which are as effective as death penalty .
