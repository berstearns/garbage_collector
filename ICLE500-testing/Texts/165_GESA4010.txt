Title: Do you think that the death penalty should be abolished? 
 
Nowadays we should be civilized enough to be able to find other forms of penalty regardless of the severeness of a crime. There are nations where death penalty is still legalized and applied. But we must ask ourselves whether it really affects the crime rate! Does it reduce criminality? Experience has shown that the crime rate in countries where death penalty is rejected as a legal form of punishment is not higher compared with those of countries where it is legally accepted .
That fact proves that criminals are not prevented from criminal actions because of the existence of death penalty. That is why we must ask ourselves whether there exist other mesures of punishment which are more effective, mesures which have a deterrent effect, acting as exemplary punishments. We know that death penalty has not been able to meet this requirement. When I write this I do not think about physical mesures of even about torture. But in my opinion being arrested for a long period of time or for the rest of the life can be the severest form of punishment for human beings. Being forced to work hard in jail without seeing any results or receiving any feedback for the work seems to me to be much more effective. Many criminals would prefer death to jail. I believe that it is worst for a human being not to have the freedom to go where one wants to and what one wishes to do. For criminals it might be easier to die than to be forced to live in imprisonment. Some even decide to commit suicide instead of being put in prison .
To decide about the life of a criminal, who still remains a human being, seems to e a little like playing god. The lifes of judges in nations where death penalty is still legalized and of those people who have to carry out the "killing" of criminals are also destroyed in some way. I can not imagine that this can be seen as a normal job. One can not go home in the evening and forget about the "work" during the day. It must be an enormous burden for everybody however hardened one is .
I have never been in the situation of a victim in such a severe case and I have not been concerned either. Although I am against all forms of violence I try to understand the feelings of affected people. I can imagine they wish to do harm to the culprit who has hurtened them, their relatives or their friends. It is just human and I am sure that I would react in a similar way. To supress the hate must be nearly impossible But we would not be better in any account, would we? From the view of affected persons death penalty might be seen as justified, for example, for murder, for abusing children or for doing harm to any other innocent person. But it does not really help the victims, does it? Maybe for a short moment there is a feeling of retaliation. But in order to cope with the situation it will take a long time and help in other forms than revenge will be required .
Of course it is much easier to insist on the abolishment of death penalty for a person who is not directly concerned. But I really believe that there are more effective forms of punishment than reacting to crimes with killing the culprits .
