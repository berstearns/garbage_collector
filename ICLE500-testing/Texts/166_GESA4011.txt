Title: Do you think that the death penalty should be abolished? 
 
In the middle of the 18th century there was no doubt about the expediency of the death penalty. The Carolina (1536) provided a death penalty in most cases of crime. The execution was extremly cruel. During the 18th century the death penalty had slowly been pushed aside by imprisonment. The fight against the death penalty has started in the Enlightment and has not ended yet. The Pro and Contra deals mainly wit two questions: 1.	The ethic question wheter the government has the right to demand the life of an individual for the sake of the community .
2.	The question wheter or not the death penalty is necessary and suits for the protection of the society .
In the German Reich the death penalty was taken into the Penal Statute again but with the restriction to murder. The execution was set through decapitation with no allowance to the public. The military Penal Statute executed through shooting .
Nowadays the death penalty is abolished in most european coutries and in some states in Northamerica. So far about the history .
I am of the opinion that the death penalty is abolished because nobody has the right to decide about the life of another person. Of course a murderer has not the right either. Anyway I think that our overcrowded prisons are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them. Sometimes their childhood had been stolen through their parents because they abused their children. But a child need not be abused. It is enough if does not feel the love of a mother or a father. If we take a look at the case of James Bulgar whose tormentors are both just 13 years old. And it is known by now, that they did never have a harmonic familylife .
But there are also people imprisoned and wait for their execution who are innocent. They never had a fair lawsuit and a real chance to get out of it. These people do often not have enough money to have their own attorney. In most cases these people who are treated unfairly are black people. Most famous example is the case of Gary Graham. It has been proven, that he had been treated unfairly, but the American Justice does not want to get into the case once again .
In addition, I think the inequality between black and white will stay forever in the minds of most of the Americans. As well as we have it in Europe with Turks, for instance .
As I mentioned before I think, that no-one has the right to decide if someone may live or not. But I must confess that I do not think the same way if somebody abuses and kills innocent children. These people should be executed as fast as possible. I believe that the children are our future and without them mankind would become extinct. What we need to learn is not childish. Being with them connects us to the deep wisdom of life, which is everpresent and only asks to believed. So, if anyone kills that source where all the love and divine comes from, he is not worth living .
Another sad and cruel thing is the way how the convict is treated. Some people received their date of execution, were lead to the execution room and were finally taken back to their cell again. But this does not happen just once. It is likely that things like that happen more than five times. It is like psychological war with the convicts .
If a state eagerly wants to kill people in a legal way, the government should create a law to do that in an instant and not after 25 years. It is not relevant that I guess .
