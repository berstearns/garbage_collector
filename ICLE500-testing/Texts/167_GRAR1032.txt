Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 

	Many years ago, people led their lives according to what religion dictated they should do, many times without thinking if those doctrines where the ones that they really believed in or because they were just used to do so, taking their ancestors as an example. However, this attitude towards life has changed the last years, and people seem to have replaced religion with television .
	Religion is one of the most important sectors in the life of all people from all the world. It keeps people together along with their country and their family, and maybe this was the main reason why people, several years ago, were so attached to it. Probably they thought that through religion their life was in an order, and that they could lead a pious life, without bad thoughts that could make them become sinners. They even thought that their life wouldn't end with death and that they would go somewhere away from sinners, in paradise, that they would be saved. So, people followed the ideas of church and they also tried to pass them to their children in the same way that these were passed to them by their parents .
	All the above may seem quite logical, as there is nothing wrong in following ideas that keep our souls "Clean", let alone that keep families, and people in general, together, as their relationship and their intentions are good and of sincere motives. However, all these hide a lot of dangers behind. There were people who not only just believed in religion but they did so in a way that they couldn't feel like they were free. Of course, there were people who followed religion because they left so, but there were also those who did so because they were brought up with particular beliefs. The latter group, which was also the majority of people, were just used to that kind of life while deep inside them they felt the need to do things that they were against what they were taught. And it is well known how many people, who could not react, became hypocrites, giving a certain impression to others and doing secretely what they wanted, even proceeding to bad acts .
	Nowadays, reaction and beliefs like the above have almost disappeared. The way and the rythm of people's life has led them to a new way of living, in which there is no more place for religion, which has been replaced by television. Not that people are not religious any more but they are not so obsessed like they used to be. However, what seems they pay more attention to is television, which they have found it as they only way they can relax with. It's the easiest solution after a tiring day, and people get used to it in a way that they don't watch it just to inform themselves or to be entertained but even to learn about the lattest gossips, about famous people, for example, something which obviously has nothing to offer them .
	Moreover, they are daily bombarded with scenes like accidents which make them have a bad psychology as well as with other inappropriate scenes, like sexual ones, which make people, even young children, to start having "saucy" thoughts. Although, all these are against religion, as they disturb, in a way, 	
	To sum up, the television nowadays has such an impact on people that has become a kind of religion. What people should pay attention to is not to watch it and let it consume them in the way religion years ago used to do .
