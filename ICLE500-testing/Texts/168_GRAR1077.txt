Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 

	It is widely accepted that, once, religion could fanaticize and totally brainwash the masses. It had become the principal social value and people considered it to be almost a necessity in their lives. According to Charles Marx, religion was the opium of the masses and this was undoubtedly correct, given that people regarded religion as a drug indispensable to life . 
	Nowadays, values have changed. Religion doesn't play such an important role anymore, but its place has been taken by the television since the early 21st century. In our days, it is a general truth that television is a primary necessity and people feel that they even can't survive without it. For this reason, we could claim that they are addicted to it, as if television were their drug .
	Firstly, people through television and, especially, through T.V. advertisements, are subject to a constant brainwash. The worst thing is that the majority of people doesn't even understand the effects of television on them. It is a general opinion that television makes use of various ways to convey its messages and affect people. The philosophy of television is based on images, which prevail and so, we become attached to it without question. Images change so quickly that we cannot react or think twice. We are exposed to a constant shift of pictures that we don't have the time to respond or to understand the brainwash that we go through .
	Furthermore, people are expected to remain passive viewers, since in this way, they are influenced more easily by television. In a similar way, the masses had become brainwashed by religion many decades earlier and they had remained passive towards this propaganda. It is apparent that, in both cases, people felt unable to react and struggle against the establishment of religion or of television. What is more, in both cases, people received messages conveyed in such a way, that they wouldn't have the chance to think twice and reject them, but they were forced to accept them without question .
	To draw a conclusion, people should understand the influence they receive from television and the brainwash they go through as passive viewers. They should awaken their minds and escape from the lethargy of television viewing. It would be very useful for them to start reading books in order to broaden their mental horizons and, finally, fight the propaganda of television. It's time that people should put an end to this underestimation of their own mind .
