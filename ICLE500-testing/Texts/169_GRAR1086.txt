Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 

	It is true that nowadays television has become a kind of religion. It is "cherished" by so many people around the world and it is given so much attention that it could be compared with any religion.
	To begin with, television has millions of fans in the world. Every household has one or more than one television devices. They are almost everywhere, like the ever-present God of a religion. This proves that just like as it happens with the religion, where people turn to find consolation from their every day problems, the same happens with television. It offers them a way to get away from their own reality. People forget their own problems simply by gazing or watching the other people's lives and problems. And this gives them great consolation because there always be someone in the world who is facing greater difficulties than you. This is certainly a comfort.
	However, this comforting situation is not so innocent. We have to consider the fanatic followers of some religions who are ready to do anything for it and do not accept any brand new or innovating ideas that could make the world better. These people are "brainwashed" with ideas of fanaticism and cannot see further in an open-minded way. The same happens with television. Specific ideas, attitudes and misleading information can cause great damage in a society. People are "bound" on their couches receiving and accepting without thought every message. This turns them to inactive television addicts who believe that television can offer them the true and do not search any further or at least test this information.
	Furthermore, the power that television has upon the people is almost divine. It imposes its will on people and they follow it as if they are blind or deaf. It has the power to create idols and leaders overnight and convince everybody about them. But sometimes these people do not deserve such treatment or even worst they can prove to be dangerous. Many talent shows will bring about to be famous people who lack talent or skills. A political compaign advertisement can make us change our minds and a rather convincing advertisement spot will tell us how to live our lives.
	Moreover, television has something to add to the consumerism of our society. The materialism is promoted through television with countless advertisements of products. As technology evolves, more attractive ways of convincing us to buy something appear. In a way we are happy and complete as human beings only if we possess the latest technological product advertised, or if we wear that clothes, or eat and drink these foods. The burden of all these products does not allow us to search further far more intellectual and spiritual completeness. So we are kept hall-asleep thinking nothing more than how we can acquire more products and show our wealth to the others. We are easily mislead and carried away without being able to react . 
	People's attitude change through television. They either imitate or follow other behaviours. In that way all people become the same and no individual can be different. This uniformity of attitude can only be catastrophic for those who want to stay different.
	Television can be the opium of masses as religion was once thought. But is up to us to understand that we have the power to control television with our critical mind and thought and make the best choises for us. We need to be awaken for everything we receive, we should not be passive and easily manipulated but open-minded and ready to react.
