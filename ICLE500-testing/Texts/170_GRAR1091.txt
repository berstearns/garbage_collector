Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 

	Considering the multi-dimensional role of religion through the years and how much has it affected certain forms of behaviour of humans anyone could agree that what we call "religion" is regarded as the strongest, firm, unchangeable belief a person can hold. Religion doesn't always refer to spiritual ideas conserning God or other supernatural force. As a matter of fact by the term "religion" one can think of his favourite football team, the relationship with a friend, family, a political belief, generally whatever has to do with a stable dedication to an idea. Sometimes close to fanatism. And only as such, Marx once characterized "religion" as the opium of the masses, and in that sense "religion" can be fairly replaced by "television".
	Although, under no circumstances could I contrast religion with television - as for me, television hardly exists - I can recognize how harmful effects can it have on humans regardless of their socio-economic backround, their culture, their age or their political beliefs. One needs no more than ten minutes to realize what kind of models are presented on television. Take first women who desperately go on strict diets, do everything to be likeable to others because of the certain models of women shown on TV every day: Women more or less of the same weight, usually taller than average, with certain way of dressing codes, certain way of maquillage, definite way of speaking, even with standardized posture. For God's Sake can all these women who look alike be actually the same; can they have the same needs; can they behave the same way in all situations? Therefore Marx talked about "masses". What actually happens with women has to do with the psychology of mass. Automatically the unique existence and personality of each human is completely banned . 
	Have you ever thought the vast amount of money a family should need to be supported nowadays? What about the kids' needs? What about the real needs of adults? How has it become necessary that a kid of eight years of age have a mobile phone in his/her possession? The worst is to follow. No parent can resist because he/she can provide no arguments against his/her kids' illogical demands. Undoubtedly, television is to blame for this superficial so-called every day needs. Even if we seem to be alert and "run" all the time to catch up with time, the truth is that we are in a lethargic situation every day and unable to react to this monstrous invention called T.V.
	Concerning unemployment, instead of being informed about the real situation of job vacancies, we are shown publicities of graduate students who automatically become managers of a company and of course "rich" with two cars, four mobiles and two maids to bring up the kids. So, we shouldn't wonder why people looking for a job, really look for a manager's position which is practically impossible. Disappointed by a rejection such a person will be definitely a psychologist's client, some time in his/her life . 
	One could argue that television can educate, inform, amuse people. It is true but only in a very tiny percentage. This is certainly not accidental. The actual purpose of T.V. is what opium does. It runs into your body gradually and in certain dosage until you become an addict. What actually does is the fact that it prevents you from thinking, deciding or expressing yourself. When you become a member of the man you have no right to change path, so consequently you've lost the right of uniqueness.
	All previous examples mentioned may have seemed exaggerating but in fact they are not. Let us not forget how people of former generations used to spent their leisure time and could manage to be happier than we are. Meeting friends regularly, joining a gym, going out for a walk, reading books, playing with the kinds and all kinds of activities one can think of, can actually fill us with energy and most important of all can make us face the real aspect of life, what our family needs, how better and fruitful our relationships can become through communication and not seated silent in front of a T.V. set.
