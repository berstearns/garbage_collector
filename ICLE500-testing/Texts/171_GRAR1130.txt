Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 

	Television has been burdened from its very birth with accusations that attack it both as a device and as a concept: it's bad for your eyes and for your mind. More than anything, however, it seems to be a controller of the masses, a monarch that rules implicitly and, thus, is even more threatening .
Being the queen of mass media, television is inevitably to blame for the dominance of popular culture. And popular culture is as great a curse as television, it seems. Together, they manipulate public taste, form opinions, shape the masses into complete uniformity. Adorno and Horckheimer have discussed this extensively, in an attempt to save the public from mental death, evidently. Very gentlemanly of them . 
	But it is not just the philosophic elite that has condemned television as being the opium of the people. Those of communist beliefs have also attributed to television and popular culture the role of controller and manipulator .
	However, it should strike one as odd that all those who condemn television seem to consider the public a mass that is willing to shallow whatever is given them. And, while it is not surprising that such an attitude would be adopted by great thinkers like Adorno, it is almost paradoxical for communists, who claim that power should be in the hands of the people, to consider that same group of people unable to decide for themselves what to watch on television .
Fortunately, Stuart Hall and others came to set things right. This new opinion took in consideration the public itself, and its ability to analyze and digest or reject the data it receives. According to Hall, a viewer is totally able to decipher the input s/he receives and decide what attitude to adopt towards that input .
	No one can claim that television is all good. However, it is good to know when to stop with conspiracy theories. It might be true, for example, that TV advertisements can have highly elaborate embedded messages in their images, but how is this any different from any other trick one might employ to sell a product? Small frauds like this are as old as buying and selling, and, in the end, why is it television's fault and not the businessman's? The medium may be different, but the fraud is old news .
	To be honest, I have been playing devil's advocate to an extent, since I'm tired of listening to all that is wrong with television. But I have watched great documentaries on television, discovered great films, relaxed with witty sit-coms. And when I'm tired of it I can press the-very underestimated - off button and get on with my life. Perhaps I'm being overly optimistic, perhaps I'm not convinced by the image of the hunching ape that evolved into a standing human being only to be reduced again into a hunching man in front of a TV. But it seems to me that the problem with the world is not television .
