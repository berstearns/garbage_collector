Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 

	The University is supposed to be among the highest institutions in all countries that has the power to make people capaple for better opportunities in life, in terms of education and a professional carreer as well. Universities are the means that "discriminate" and categorize people in society and mainly in the professional field .
	There are Institutions that are concidered to be even higher from the average Universities (for example the French Grand Ecoles), but undoubtedly whoever succeeds in entering a University is considered to have a better chance in life, than for example a person who has not been educated further more, after high school .
	The reason this situation exists is mainly the recognition a person can achieve after obtaining a University degree. Recognition in terms of knowledge and achievement. Universities are considered to be the highest of all other educational institutions and this fact makes a person's admission to them quite difficult . (Especially in cases like the Greek Universities that are public).
	On the other hand, even though the admission to a University happens to be difficult, the degree it offers after some years of study happens to be mostly theoretical. This results to the fact that a student, holder of his bachelor, enters the real world without having any kind of experience (practical) regarding his studies. Sometimes bachelor degree holders end up having jobs completely irrelevant to the subject that they had been studying, for maybe 6 or 7 years .
	On the other hand there are other institutions concerning people who have not succeeded in entering a University. Technological institutions and many kinds of private schools or "University - like" institutions offer a variety of studies including practice on certain study fields (such as finance, or tourism studies). This might be considered a more organized and responsible choice to make, in order to succeed in a future working environment, especially the one that requires working experience right after the obtaining of a degree .
	Are these institutions more well informed or well organized from a University? They might be. However the University has been the one and only "top" acceptable institution that has the power to "form" the personalities and promote the majority of the future scientists and the future leaders as well .
Concerning working experience and practice, it is a fact that many University departments apply some semestrial obligatory (sometimes) interships for their students (such as agronomy departments, medicine, civil engineering etc). So, the bachelor degree holder mostly do not come out of the University not having a clue about what they are going to do in their lifes .
	In addition, as far as I am concerned, regarding the University departments that do not apply such procedures concerning working practice during studying, if a student wants to work it is up to him/her to do so, either by looking for an intership within the University gates or even in the real world .
There are job opportunities everywhere. What the University is meant to do, is to prepare us for the real world, by giving us the opportunity of free choice and independence. For I believe that a University department that does not apply immediate working practice, has its own power and way to make its students independent and responsible about what they should choose .
	Maybe this is the best. The role of the University is to give us some basic ideas (theoretical) about what obtions we have. The final choices are up to us. This freedom of will and choice maybe is not applied to the other institutions. That makes the University studies unique and desirable.
