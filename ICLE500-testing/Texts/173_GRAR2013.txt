Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 


	Even from the time, we are young children, we listen to our parents telling us how important it is to pass the exams and be accepted in the university. They believe that the university degree will help their children to find a better job, a better salary and generally that if they have the university degree they can fullfil their goals .
	However, most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. During the studies, most students are bombardized by knowledge that is not necessary for their job success. They do not learn things that will help them to overcome the obstacles in their job career. They become cultivated and they can analyze many opinions and show that they have studied a lot. But when there is time to show and use their knowledge in a real situation, they feel lost . 
	The university degrees should be more practical. Students should spend more time in practical courses that would provide them with all the necessary knowledge and tips for becoming successful in their domain. Students must feel already professionals when they finish their university studies .
University should give the chance to the students to watch or even work during their studies next to professionals of their department. Through this experience students will understand what their profession really is, if they like it and what they have to do if they want to succeed in. Students should have the option to visit many European countries under the guidance of their university department and watch how other universities work and maybe they could also participate in common projects .
	Moreover, university degrees could be more valuable, if it would be obligatory for students to work for a while in big institutions and be tested if they can manage difficult situations. After this working experience, students would feel more confident and their university degree would have great value . 
To conclude, university degrees should be more practical and they should give to the students the chance to come across real life situations during their university studies. Students must not feel unprotected as soon as they start their professional career; university should and can make them feel confident to gain their lives. The value of the university degrees must be great so as to reassure the students that they have studied hard and their goal to be successful in their profession will soon come true. If the students will have these university degrees, it will be easier for them to find a job and they will be paid very well for their servings. Finally, the extra studies, master degrees will not be as necessary as now because the students will have all the standards for being productive and successful .
	The University degrees must gain their value and the universities as institutions must give the best opportunities to their students for a better life; social and professional. The value of the university degrees is the students' identity. The university degrees must be flexible and change each time that the needs of our life and era are different. Education must be as alive as we are .
