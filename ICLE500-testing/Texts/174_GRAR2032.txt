	It is true that most university degrees are theoretical and do not provide any kind of practice, but I certainly do not believe that they do not prepare students for the real world and that they are of very little value. However, I believe that not all university degrees are theoretical, there are some university degrees that prepare students adequately for their professional life .
	To begin with, I do believe that most university degrees are theoretical, but that does not necessarily mean that they are useless. In order for someone to become a good professional, that is to be able to do his job correctly, he should have the theoretical background that is needed. In other words, he should have a deep knowledge of all the theories and research that have been developed or carried out in his field of study and then, after he has acquired all this knowledge he will be able to apply them in the future at his job. For example, a teacher does not only have to have knowledge of the subject he is teaching but also he should be aware of all the methodologies and approaches to language teaching and learning so that, when the time comes, he should be able to judge which methodology is the appropriate one for his students and how he should adapt it to fit the needs and wants of the students. All this knowledge of the different kinds of methodologies and research about ways of teaching and ways of learning can be found only in books that are used by theoretical courses in universities and this kind of knowledge is not something that someone can learn by practice .
	The fact that theoretical knowledge is necessary, it certainly does does not mean that practice is not important and that universities should not provide practice to their students so that they can be better prepared for the real world and for what problems they will have to face in the future, when they will working. I truly believe that practice of the students should something obligatory for all students in all universities no matter what the field of study of the student is. It is vital that students have the opportunity to apply all the theoretical knowledge they have acquired during their university studies. The knowledge the students have acquired is meant to be used by them in their everyday working situation in the future and not to stay in their mind forever. For that reason, it is very important that universities give to their students the chance to apply the knowledge they have and the universities should also show them how they can achieve put into practice what they know from their theoretical courses. For example, a graduate of the English Department may be aware of all the methodologies and of all the theories, in general, about language teaching and learning but he may not know how to use all this knowledge in an effective way. This means that students, whatever their field of study, needs guidance by his teachers that are more experienced. Another reason why universities should offer this opportunity to their students is that students need experience. When someone graduates and he is looking for a job, all the employers are looking for someone who has experience that a person who has just completed his studies and has not had any practice during his university studies, he cannot find and thus he cannot find easily a job .
	To sum up, it is vital that students have both theoretical and practical courses. They should have theoretical courses that will provide them all the knowledge that they need and practical course that will help them apply the knowledge that they have acquired in their theoretical courses .
