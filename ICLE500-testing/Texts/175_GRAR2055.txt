Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 

	Nowadays, a degree is not anymore just a title of education, knowledge or a certification but the first step in the world of employment and experience. It is a base on which will be built a career. The ideal condition would be that by the time that a students finishes university would be able to put into practice if not all, at least the major part of the knowledge that he has acquired during his academic life. But this is not always the case .
It is a matter of fact that some particular subjects are by nature more theoretical than others but even in these cases there is room for practice. For example it sounds very reasonable that a student of chemistry will have more practice hours than of student of philosophy. The problems, though, are spoted in cases where a particular school or department even though it has to spend a seasonable amount of time in practicing it chooses not to do so. It can be so due to a shortage of money, staff or laboratories, due to unwillingness or even unawareness. But this is certainly a problem. Students should be able to come in contact with their subject of study not only in a theoretical base but in a practical as well otherwise they will certainly face difficulties in being accepted for a post. Unemployment is one of the most important social problems of our time and one of the reasons for which we do face unemployment is improper training and competition. In a competitive society the more qualified you are the more possibilities you will have to find a job. Training and practice are essential because through them you gain experience and you actually realize whether you have acquired the knowledge, skills requested or not .
I would not agree with the statement that a theoretical degree is of very little value since theory is a prerequisite for practice - if there is no theoretical background then practice cannot be achieved. But I cannot accept that a degree is enough in order to get a job. What universities or other educational institutions can do for this is to provide training seminars or case-studies, workshops and appropriate programs for the preparation of future candidates .
	Of course students are also responsible for theirselves in this area of training. If there is no will then there won't be any results. Students should take initiatives and ask for practical courses or educational visits that will help them to get acquainted with their future working environment and if possible with their future emphyers. A possible solution would be a part-time practice or the student's participation as volunteers in places appropriate and relevant to their field of studies .
	Apart from finding a job a degree should be seen as an opportunity to enter a world of knowledge and information different from the kind of knowledge that we were presented in secondary education. Universities promote critical thinking and allow personal opinions or research. In university classrooms the student is just being motivated to discuss, think of something and the rest is up to him - the teacher will provide the "food for thought", the student chooses whether to accept the challenge or not. He is challenged to decide whether to agree with what is being taught or to ignore it completely etc .
	Therefore even the skill of judging and the opportunities to use critical thinking are valuable. It is a value that will follow the student in all his life and in my opinion it is more precious and more important than practical experience which is something that can be realised anytime later. Critical thinking therefore is a valuable qualification that accompanies an academic degree and even if there is absence of practice it certainly values a lot .
