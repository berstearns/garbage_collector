Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 

	Most university degrees are indeed so much based on theory and huge analyses that they do not prepare students for the real world. It is my belief that these degrees for sure, they have their own value but if and when the practical aspects of these degrees will be called for then they will be confronted with hardships. First of all it depends on the degree that students study for if theory is needed or if it is needed provided that it is less. Thus there are certain degrees which require mostly theory in the years that are taught in the university. Even in the real world a professor of theology has to speak in theory and to give extended analyses. The university degree will have him/her equiped with all the required knowledge which will cover the biggest part of his future needs in work as a professor. The theory factor will also help a student of philosophy to perceive the abstract notions which he/she will later analyse to her/his students. However these theoretical degrees do not prepare students to become just analysers and theoreticians since these teachers are going to teach to students and to occupy with students for all of their work career. As a result they will have to be able to explain theory in perceivable way and not in a way which will possibly have confusing results students attempt to understand. Still an educational theory is argued that is enough to cover this space. In my view a theory about how languages are taught to students of all levels, of how students can be tested or how a reliable scoring and evaluation can be given is not possible. All these aspects of teaching cannot be learnt by theory but practice is called for and it should be obligatory to all students who are going to teach.
	Surely the reason that some other degrees are theoretical, whereas practice is their main subject and practice is what will be required in the real world, can be justified. However in my view some theory is still needed there just because of the fact that practice is based on theoretical rules. First comes the theory and the practice follows. Therefore the degree for a physician or a mathematician is not valuable when it is deeply theoretical and when students haven't learn to apply all these theories on natural and real world uses. Theory will be forgotten and basic notions which were taught in practice in combination with theory will allow the future worker or teacher to have a general idea of the subject. In real world these basic ideas will contain mostly practice. Therefore that is what they must acquire in most of all while they study in university . 
	To sum up, university degrees even if in their essence are theoretical they should also include some practice because that is after all where the successful teaching of theory will be based. Notwithstanding the purely theoretical degrees by their nature, all the other degrees should sacrifice some theory so as for practice to benefit .
