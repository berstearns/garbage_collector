Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

	During the last decades tremendous changes have occur in a woman's life and roles in a society. The feminist movement has contributed largely to that and as every big and important current as this, it has brought many diversities of opinions and argues and debates. Many are the supporters who strongly agree to it but many are the ones who oppose and report that feminism is the cause for the "corruption" of a woman .
	But lets see the matter from a closer point of view. Due to feminism, woman has power. She is an important and respectable tool to a society, who contributes for the generous improvement in it. A woman since late 70's has gained the freedom of speech and will. She is independent and can participate, take action in al the sections of life. Horizons in job, house, family, sexual relationships and state affairs have expanded. In the society of the 20th century we see woman in very high and strong positions, head principles, general manager, scientists, musicians and even presidents, as lady Thatcher in Britain years ago .
	Also, women's role in a house and family has taken another form. She is not anymore the one responsible for house labour and raising the children but these roles have become etc. hangeable with the other sex and less demanding so as for a woman to fill her personality with other interests .
	Thirdly, sexual relationships are more loose and gives the woman the opportunity to meet a lot of individuals, live or marry many times (of course the number of legitimate marriages varries from country to country) and discover with whom she can be satisfied and happy. This is very important since in the old days women had fixed weddings and were forced to spend their life with a person they hardly knew .
	As we see, feminism, has brought dramatic changes in a woman's role which have led to an improvement of life standards. But let me mention at this point the bad effects of this social movement. The strong devotion to job necessities causes less valuable time to build a personal life. Carreerists spend many years in job qualification and either end up bachelors or with a miserable family. Children grow up with the lack of motheressee care and husbands feel at their bones the ellipsis of their wife. This is an important reason why many couples divorce in our days .
	Also, since women have become very active in a society's marketing consumption an immense part of products is addressed to her, having as a result the brainwashing of her needs and an incline to materialism. As a result, we witness many women today to talk only about how they must go to a gym, buy all kinds of hydrating cremes and cosmetics and not to mention the tendency or better passion for buying clothes. Overall when the main core of feminism is sidetracked it, we end up with the diversion of the essential goals' which is freedom and independence .
	A feminist movement was very much needed when it was forced upon the countries. But since then, the societies have changed, and the issue is not if feminism has done more harm or more good but to employ feminism according the basis, structure of each society, in order for women not to loose their real personality. For example, feminism as it is expressed in Western countries cannot be applied upon Eastern ones who remain far behind modern civilization. A mousoulman woman who has learned all her life to dress in long dresses and hide their faces with big scarfs cannot be forced to wear minies and dye her hair. She needs a legitimate system who will prevend misbehave from her husband, as it is accustomed to many countries, like Iran, Iraque and not one who will let her buy modern clothes and cosmetics. Feminism is an active movement who needs to be modified throughout the years in order to be applied to societies having as a basis the real, actual needs of a woman.
