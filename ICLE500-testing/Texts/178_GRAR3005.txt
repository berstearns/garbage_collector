Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

	The concept of feminism is not a simple one. The effects it had upon society, including men and women, cannot be characterized as just good or bad. Once it appeared as a trend in academic circles first, it challenged people's and especially women's worldview. Until now feminists all over the world define the concept of "feminism" in various ways depending on their experiences in life as well as their studies. For me, feminists' attribution to the improvement of women's life and position in the society is great. Hadn't be the feminists who some decades ago declared women's independency, women would live until now supporting their husbands and family instead of themselves, would have no personal life, would not enjoy the joy of being self-sufficient and dynamic .
	However, changes in a well-established patriarchical system cannot be radical. Things concerning women's rights change slowly and not in the same rate in all countries. In West women took advantage of the feminism whereas in East and in Africa many things have to be done to improve the bad conditions under which women live .
	As an ideology which once it appeared had great effects on societies, it is logical and expecting to have its extreme supporters. Maybe the people who accuse feminists of having done more harm to women that good, have in mind feminist's extreme supporters. It is also expecting for an ideology such as feminism to get negative criticism and sabotage from those who benefited from the pre-existed patriarchical system .
	Nevertheless I don't think that our society has ceased to be patriarchical. Men are the leaders, men are paid more than women for the equal work, in Greek Parliament women constitute only the 10% of the representatives. Men who are afraid of feminism and attack it in every chance have unfortunately misunderstood what feminism is for. Feminists do not seek to take men's position, they just want women to be in a Cooperative role, to make decisions for themselves and for our society as only men until recent years did .
	As a young girl I cannot imagine myself living in a subordinate way like my grandmother. Fortunately feminism once occurred in Europe influenced Greece and for this reason my mother's attitudes were of that kind that promoted her independency of girls, open-mindness and self-sufficiency. Next generations live obviously in better conditions as far as their rights are concerned and this is due to feminism. Of course problems concerning the female gender continue to exist. Feminism is an ideology adaptable to different times and once most women believe in how it can change their life, less women will be victims worldwide .
