Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

	During the time that the movement of feminism started to be developed, every woman in the world that believed that has something to improve about her situation either in her home or generally in society took part in the struggles that this particular movement was giving. The original and the general target of those women, who were considered as rebels at those times, was they demanded to became equal to men, something that was not happening in a male-governed society. Women's demands included equal education, equal opportunities for job, equal salaries and generally they wanted to gain the same respect as men did .
	A lot of intellectual and open-minded women of that period wrote articles or even books with hints that depicted the ideas of feminism and when the movement started to have wider appreciation of the women globaly the messages that those writers were "sending" through their pieces of work started became clear. That movement helped a lot in order women to earn the respect they deserved and make the societies all over the world to consider them useful and not inferior to men, eventhough there are a lot of other things that have to be fixed about woman's situation, such as the woman's abusen from men; either sexually or psychologically .
	But unfortunately there are women who want to consider themselves as feminists who don't fight right a woman should have in a society but they try to convince that women should become exactly the same with men, even in bad habits that men is believed to have. The new generation of "feminists-like" women wants women even to sleep with any man they meet without sensitivity and emotions, just like they believe a man does. They found weird and not-accepted ways of protesting their demands, such as parading naked along streets and screaming insulting and "dirty" signals. They believe that men are not worthy to be respected and they are bad and evil by nature. The weird thing though is that they try to become like men, who they hate so much, since their demand is to become totally same with them. By doing all these things and demanding this weird equality the only consequence is that they lose completely their sexuality and those special features that make them women. What people nowadays think about the so-called feminists is that they are women who does not want to improve woman's situations but with their actions they try to make it worse. This "thing" has nothing to do with the original term of the movement of "feminism" since the first feminists, as a matter of fact, did gave struggles and fights for the woman to have a better life and everything she deserves .
	They were rebels because they did wanted the society to change dramatically and make women to have an active role in it (e.g. the right of woman to vote) and not to be seen as creatures whose only roles were to be wives and giving birth. The difference is that the fake-feminists are rebels without reason, since they do not fight against women's problem such as sexual abuse that is spread dramatically in our days but their only target is women to become men's caricatures .
