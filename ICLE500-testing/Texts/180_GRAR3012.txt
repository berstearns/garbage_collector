Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

	Nowadays the position women have in the society is considered to be equal with the position of men. However, some years before women did not have such a position, they were regarded as inferior to men and not clever enough to work and study in universities. Their role was that of mother, wife and housekeeper. Nothing more, nothing less .
	The huge changes in the position of women was achieved through the act of feminist. As a result, I strongly disagree with the statement that: "feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good". If the feministic movement would not have arised then the women would still be treated like animals in circus. We used to live in a patriarchal society were men's dominance was taken for granted. Women in those societies were not considered as human beings but only important for the extension of the human species. On the one hand men were allowed to work, to study to universities, go out and come whenever they like and not obliged to help with the house-work. On the other hand women were not allowed to study at universities, or work, they were not permitted to go out and they were forced to bring up children, cook, wash and make all the housework . 
	In addition, in our modern society women do not pocess the role they used to. They are allowed to do whatever they want, they can go to universities, decide whether marry or not and finally they are considered to be clever enough to compete with a man. But even though those changes have accured we cannot admit that we do not still live in a somewhat patriarchal society. We can admit that women are in a better position than they were in past times but when nowadays a woman is married and also working, she is obliged by the unspoken rule to do on her own the housework and to raise the children without her husband's help .
	This fact leads to the exhaustion of the woman. She has to work, to be there for her children and to take care of the house. As a result she has no time for herself. So, if we consider carefully nowadays circumstances, we will understand that not so many things have changed. Something that I should add so as not to exaggerate is that not all women face such treatment. Some men nowadays respect the role of women and the equality of the two sexes. This minority of men give hope for the future. If gradually all men and women as well start to realize the importance of both genrs and the equality of them then there will be no need for feministic discussion .
	To sum up, the feministic movement helped a great deal with the improvement of the position of women. Feminists cannot do much if we, people, especially men do not understand the basic idea of feminism and realize that no person, either man or woman, is superior of inferior to anyone else .
