Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

	The feministic movement which made its appearance in the second half of the 19th century, has undoubtedly achieved much in changing the condition of a woman's life over the previous years. As a matter of fact, women can nowadays vote, work, study and, generally speaking, do almost everything that a man does. But is this really for women's good or all these feministic "achievements" resulted rather in harm than good?
	To begin with, no one can deny that women's predicament, during previous years, was suffocating. Women lived under the dominance of men and they were entitled to live through and for domestic sphere. In other words, they were supposed to fulfill the role of a dutiful mother and obedient wife, while they were excluded from any kind of social life, they did not have access to education, as they were confined to domesticity, and they couldn't even leave their house without their husband's omission, otherwise they should give a proper excuse for their absence. In fact, patriarchal authority was always there to impose severe punishment to those women who made any attempt for independence and, especialy, to those who could adhere not easily to the sexual pattern they had been taught to follow. These restrictions, in combination with the patriarchal punishments, even reached death sometimes, usually with the excuse that particular women were peculiar, mentally unbalanced or, simply, disobedient to their husbands. Obviously, divorce was not a typical solution, as only man had the right to abandone his wife if he wanted .
	Nowadays, all these have pretty much changed; women are no longer considered to be treated as something inferior than men, and the same opportunities are offered to both, as far as education, politics and occupation is concerned, in the name of the equality of two sexes. However, it seems that the obligations of women have now has dramatically increased, as they now have to work outside their house and inside, as well. That happened because real equality between men and women have not really been achieved yet. Indeed, women have now to face the same burden of housekeeping, which has traditionaly remained a woman's duty, together with the job responsibilities that she now has. And it would be an omission not to add, here her primary role of being a mother, as well .
	Consequently, women are nowadays, torn out of complicated duties, and they're exausting themselves in a race with which they try to prove that they're capable of everything. They want to be successful businesswomen, to keep their houses clean and tidy, to spend time with their children, to try to go the gym in order to be still desirable to their husbands, and, maybe find some time for themselves to spend with their own friends. Obviously, such thing is not possible because you cannot do many things and still be good in all of them. Nobody can do it because nobody is made from steel (not even women!)
	The solution for women's overburdened situation is not, of course, to return to the old patriarchal system, which not only denies any right to women but it also dehumanizes them. On the contrary, it relies on each man's personal feelings for his own wife. In other word, men should take action in the housekeeping, as well, instead of expecting everything to be done from their own wives. In this way, equality will not stay outside the family, but will be in depth, instead of a superficial word, which has only deteriorated women's predicament .
