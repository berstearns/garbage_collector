Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

	Modern world was a dream for the past generations and a reality for the people of today. After so many struggles and difficulties, humanity has reached very far in so many fields such as science and technology that noone could have imagined fifty years ago. Who could imagine that with the use of just one button in our personal computers we could get information about the news all over the world! Not to mention the fact that couples can chose what the sex of their future child will be! All these and many many others consist what we, the people of the modern world, experience in our every day life. But there is always a question; does all this improvement leave some space for people to dream and imagine?
	Before we answer the question above, it would be nice to have a closer view of what living in the modern world means. Starting from the everyday reality someone could say that people's lives have become much more suppressive since the obligations are getting biger. What society expects from its people is much different from that many years ago. Today they should work harder, which has as a result to rest less, sleep less even think less . 
	Technology improvement and industialization has made life easier but more mechanised and automatized thing that leaves no space for human creativity. Today almost every wish of ours can become true - you can even have a cyber "boyfriend"! We should not forget to mention that even though technology has brought all the world close, people have became greatly alienated. Few people decide to meet each other since the "facility" of the internet makes something like that unnecessary. All the above prove that even though the standard of today's people living is better, there are also disadvantages that have to do mostly with human communication and feelings, not to mention dreaming and imagination, since what one dreams can probably become true .
	As a conclusion we could say that living in the modern world has its benefits and drawbacks. Noone can deny how the improvement in science and technology has helped humanity, how many people have been saved from disaster. However all these have an impact, especialy on peoples psycology. Despite all the difficulties each one should create its own resistance and not leave "modernity" "steal" its dreams and its right to imagine, because this relies only on people's hands. Although we are materially wealthy, life in the modern world is spiritually impoverished. People have lost touch with nature and no longer have an intimate relationship with their surroundings. In some countries family bonds have broken down and parents cannot spare the time to speak to their children. Pressures at work are so great that people are unable to lead a relaxed family life. In many ways, the world is a better place than it was fifty years ago. Many of us enjoy a very high standard of living. In the developed countries of the world, people have free schooling, excellent medical care, spacious homes, plenty to eat and almost full enjoyment. So far, there do not seem to be any limits to human progress. We get richer and richer year by year but does all this improvement really leave space for people to dream and imagine?
