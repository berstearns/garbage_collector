	Nowadays, it is quite often admitted that the modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, does not leave any place for dreaming and imagination. This is actually a serious problem and it should be taken into serious consideration .
	In the first place it is really obvious that the rapid development of science and technology had a serious effect on people's psychology while industralization affected somehow negatively life in the big cities. Science and technology have certainly improved and brought a lot of advantages in our life but, on the other hand, they have caused a lot of problems and most importantly they have left no place for dreaming and imagination. People have become too much addicted to the messages carried by the television and all the other innovations of technology. As a result they do not feel free to dream and imagine because they lead a life which is clearly directed by science and technology. In many cases, they have substituted activities which offer them the opportunity to dream and imagine with activities that they do not do so. Spending a lot of hours in front of the television or the computer has certainly taken a lot of time from people which in an other case they could spend by reading a literature or poetry an activity that offers a great opportunity for dreaming and expanding our imagination .
	On the other hand, life in the big cities which is to a large degree, affected by industrialization, has become really monotonous, dull, boring and unpleasant. Industrialisation has caused great isolation, alienation and lack of communication among people. Human relations have become impersonal and because of this people feel really depressed, pessimistic and they try hopelessly to find a goal and a sense in their lives. The routine, the problems of everyday life and the high demands of the modern world to which they try to respond do not offer them a place for dreaming and imagination. Moreover, due to the demands of their job they do not have free time for themselves and free time for taking up hobbies and travelling and any other activities that would let them to get away from the routine and that would set their soul free to dream and imagine. In general, living in a world that causes great insecurity, frustration, depression and allienation because of the domination of science, technology and industrialisation, does not let people to dream and imagine .
Actually, some solutions should be certainly be found to this problem. First of all, people should try to regain their self - confidence and self - respect and try to require some kind of hope and optimism for the future. Moreover, they should resort to nature and try to regain respect and love for it. Moreover love for music literature and any other kind of art will certainly offer them the opportunity to cultivate their soul. It is quite obvious that such measures will certain offer some solution to the problems and they will certainly offer them a place for dreaming and imagination .
	In conclusion, the domination of science, technology and industrialisation is a basic characteristic of our modern world. Despite the great scientific and technological innovation and despite the progress that the world has made because of them, science and technology together with the industrialisation has brought a lot of disadvantages one of the most important of which is that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. It is necessary, therefore, that some actions should be taken so that people will be able to dream and imagine .
