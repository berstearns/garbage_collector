Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

	It is universally acknowledged that the society of today has achieved a profound evolution at all fields of life, as compared to what was achieved in the old times. Nowadays, we live in an industrialized society where human hands have been replaced by the most - highly - developed machines. Technological innovations have facilitated people's everyday life. In the area of science, there have been made great steps for understanding and exploring the natural world as well as the human being, such as the decoding of the human DNA. However, there have been posed many questions about whether this rapid technological and scientific improvement is responsible for the social alienation and dehumanization of the individual, about whether people have barricaded on themselves, have become less humane, materialistic and have made money their top priority . 
	On the one hand, we cannot neglect the undeniable fact that the technological and scientific development has facilated people's life to a great extent and has helped to familiarize with the human nature and, especially, with the human psyche .
	The decoding of the human DNA is a crucial medical success, since scientists will be able, through experiments and researches, to find cure to diseases that are considered by now as fatal. Human cloning, if it is ever applied, will prove to be of utmost importance for those people who may need an organ transplant .
	In addition, in terms of the technological field, we have the invasion of computers and television as ways of entertainment and relaxing. As far as computers are concerned, not only are they useful in our professional life, but they also offer us, and especially the youth, opportunities to make new acquaintances with people from all over the world, through the use of Internet. So, it could be said that, in this view, computers have put aside the old tradition of having a penfriend. Nowadays, young people can communicate with people from other countries by entering a chat-room or by sending e-mails that are read and answered by the receivers directly, with absolutely no waste of time, in contrast to the old way of corresponding .
	Television is a means of entertainment and relaxation after a very tiresome day. It can live up to everybody's interests, since it includes a variety of channels and programs, starting from childhood up to the elderly people .
	However, on the other hand, there is a great deal of drawbacks because of the excessive industrialization and need to become even more successful . 
First and foremost, the human being has become very vain and gready. He chases money, power and fame as a result he has lost his sensitive and humane feelings. Vanity has made him very selfish and materialistic without understanding that there may come one day when he will lose everything and he may have to begin again from scratch. Trying to catch up with this new way of life and to live up to the society's expectations, man has lost his critical thinking. He doesn't care anymore for social contact, for real communication with other people, because he thinks of everyone around him as a rival. Stress conquers him. In his effort to survive in the hustle and the bustle of the society, he forgets who he really is, where he started from, his dreams, his real goals in life. Nowadays, his goal is to create a successful career and not to become a good person. In the society of today, there is no place for imagination and dreams. The number one priority is money, career .
	Consequently, the human being barricades on himself, is alienated from the outer world. During his entire life, he struggles to create a highly-esteemed personality, a highly-acknowledged career and, in the end, he realizes that he has lost the real essence of life .
	All in all, taking into consideration both pros and cons of the issue, I firmly believe that technological and scientific innovations have improved the quality of our daily life, but this has been done at the expense of our personal life and of our communication with our human beings if this plight deteriorates, then I don?t want to consider its consequences on the human nature .
