Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

	It is true that in our modern world, concidering the development that has been noticed in the scientific and technological fields, it is a little difficult to find a place for dreaming and imagination; dreaming-that is in that pure escense of a child's soul .
	Lots of people believe that the industrialization of our life has made it impossible for us to make dreams. They tend to see development in a negative perspective, allowing technology to play a very small part in their every-day life - still, this isn't true for all of these people; some of them may use a lot of science's discoveries and take advantage of the technological progress but, at the same time they keep complaining for the loss of innocence. They keep accusing development for the loss of dreaming and imagination; as if people don't have the time to dream any more or someone has deprived them of their freedom to imagine a better life!
	In my opinion, the truth lies somewhere in the middle; people may have lost some of their old ideology but there is always a place and a little time for us to dream. Probably this is because a life without dreaming couldn't go on; people need to make dreams in order to escape every-day life's difficulties and problems. This is the only solution, the only way to deal with our life's routine and get through, without falling into deep depression. After all, there would not be any technological or scientific development if people didn't make dreams .
	It is rather obvious that all of our modern society's achievements are a result of people's imagination! If human beings didn't have dreams for a-constantly becoming-better future, then we would still live in a primitive society and we would have conciliated with the idea of a life full of difficulties, a life full of personal struggle for survival!
	People are-even in our modern world - able to dream and imagine how their life could be better, not only in a personal aspect but also, concerning other human beings. We all need to make dreams for our world to continue developing. The world is not dominated by science, technology or industrialization; these are all human's achievements taking advantage of which society can continue progressing. The world is dominated by us, people and by correctly using this authority that has been given to us, we can make miracles in every scientific field! The responsibility lies in our hands; it's our dreams that become realized; our imagination in practice that brings all these technological revolutions. As long as people with spontaneity and good will are alive, there is always a place for dreaming and imagination. It's the same place where we can find all of our modern world's accomplishments .
