Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

	Everyone of us, when we are young, we dream of how our life will be when we get to be when we are grow adults and what proffession we will have. Most of us dream to be worldwide known, rich and have and happy families. All of these dreams are crushed after the years pass, and we all accept the fact that we will have an ordinary eight to five job in order to support ourself. A job that we may not even like. Dreamers and imaginative people don't seem to fit in to this world no more. Science, technology and industrialisation has taken all of this away.
	There was a time when scholars, writers, composers, poets, thinkers and in general all of those people who were dreamers of a better world and who lived to give us parts of their imagination, that they were looked up to, and people valued their work. Nowadays that logic and money are the most worshipped values of life, there is nor time nor taste left for our people to appreciate the beauty of these things. The dreamers and the ones who imagine and want to see the world become a better place, are mocked upon.
	Some time ago, most of the people believed strongly in God, acted as he willed and tried to improve themselves to be better human being. They believed in the abnormal and the metaphysics. They maybe were naive to believe this things and "Had a strong imagination" but at least they were not as thick-skinned as we have become. Science has taken that away from us. These days most young people are atheists since they believe that either they have evolved from the apes (Darwin) or have evolved from cells and chromosomes...
	Walking down town, we see people running off to somewhere with their suits on, not noticing the wheather nor the people around them. They don't have time for that. How can they even think of having time to dream?! By the time that we are eighteen or so we somehow know that we will be one day, one of those, always - in-a-hurry men and women. Our industrialized world forces us to.
	When we were young we played outdoors in the neighboorhood with the neighboors kids and our friends from school, always getting ourselves wet and dirty, until all of our mothers came outside and yelled for us to go inside. Nowadays, children don't bother going outside because they are too hooked up playing video games, watching television, or surfing down the Internet. Technology has offerred them so much visual reality that they seem to forget that it is only visual not real. Sometimes I wonder even if they forget having friends... These kids will eventually lack imagination and will have nothing to remember by of their childhood.
	Noone can argue that science these days has gone a long way. They have found cures for many diseases, had the human kind walk on the moon, they know now more than ever how the human body functions and even how to recreate a human exactly like someone else (clones). But a human is more than that ... It thinks, it crys, it laughs, it has nightmares, it falls in love, it gets angry, sad etc. To these thinks they have given little significanse to.
	All of these that we have noted above are the reasons why the human kind has grown to be so flat, in the way they think and why they stopped dreaming and imaginating things. Since we stopped dreaming we stopped being that different from one another. We have to start dreaming again, so that we can picture inside of us a better future, a better humanity... And as Martin Luther King said "I have a dream"....
