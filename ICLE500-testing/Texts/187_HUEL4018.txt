Title: Mobile phone leads to loneliness

In the course of human history members of different communities have always felt the need for the company of their acquaintances. As time past, technological improvement appeared, mainly from the 20th century, n order to be able to contact with our relations, friends or lovers more easily and quickly. The first of this kind was the telephone and prefebly the mobile phone. However, it has become a tool which unconsciously though, but makes us feel lonely in the most negative sense.
The meaning of the worked loneliness has altered in the last couple of decades. While in the past it meant the time of examining ourselves or fro some being artistic, in the present century the members of a community feel neglected if they cannot contact with somebody by using a technological device called mobile phone. The member of a family tend to priorities talking on the phone to talking to each other. Even the undisturbed family meals have disappeared. Adults and children lose everyday contact because of the phone's presence. They consider telecommunication more important than real private communication. Therefore, the members of the family become lonesome in the world!
In addition to feeling as an outcast in the family, a person can also be abandoned by his or her friends. People get accustomed to be able to call their friends any time in order to tell about every little events which happens. Nevertheless, if something un expected occurs it gives the feeling of ignorance and neglect. In the past it was a natural thing to not to hear from a friend for weeks. Friends wrote long letters to each other. However, friends are obliged to response immediately otherwise the receiver is left lonesome. This person cannot be blamed for this kind of emotion. Not receiving an answer certainly makes one ignored. It is the speed of this communication device which has to be accused of.
Lastly, there is the relationship with our partner which is also effected by the use of mobile phones. Most people would disagree with its negative effects. They consider that it is wonderful to contact with our lover anytime during the day. There is no doubt about its magic especially when a couple is still very much in love. On the other hand, as their relationship progresses it becomes a disturbing factor. Partners talking during the day lose their interest in the other person by the time they meet. If they discuss different issues, beforehand, on the phone there is nothing to talk about personally. It gives the impression of being left alone for ourselves. Moreover, if connection cannot be completed a person feels offended and abandoned. Being in love does not last as long as it did in the past. In old times a woman or a man could remain in love with somebody for even a lifetime. Nowadays, it is impossible. Lovers open to the other opposite sex in a year. as much as they did in ten years time in the past.
In conclusion, mobile phone is a deceiving device of communication. Users expect to feel closer to others by possessing one. However, it leads to the opposite direction and makes people blind to observe the things which are really important in life.
