Title: Mobile phones equal bad manners

Nowadays almost every single person holds a mobile phone, wherever they go, whatever they do. Mobile phones are very useful but can be very annoying at the same time. Unfortunately, a large number of people owning such telephones can not use them in a way that would not disturb the others around.
These are a great number of places where the use of mobile phones should be banned.
First of all, I would not let people bring these devices in theatres or cinemas switched on. The best way of saving great plays or films from being interrupted would probably be to extend a special electric net around such institutes, so people could not use them even if they wanted to. There is nothing more irritating than - when being absorbed in watching great actors - s sharp ringing breaking the romantic silence. At least for me, as for the audience, I feel so. But what might the actors feel then?
Secondly, on flights using mobiles can be really dangerous as they might interfere with the various devices of the plane and it can lead to disasterous events. No matter how many times and in how many languages people are asked to switch off their phones, there are always a few to ignore the request.
Additionally, I often hear people talking about so intimate and so private happenings! I would like to close my ears. Even if they are in central places (not in cinemas or at some meetings but let us say in the street) they should lower their voices, as the things they are talking about are not anybody else's business.
A certain number of people seem to behave as if they were the only ones in the world and absolutely ignore that other persons are around as well, who might not wish to listen to what these are discussing, talking or arguing about.
I do not say that mobile phones and other high-tech devices are to be blamed for people being so ignorant. Modern devices are very useful, they can even save lives or simply make our lives easier and more comfortable. It is the people who should know how to behave in public.
If I were in charge of an organisation of selling mobile phones or distributing any similar high-tech devices, I would definitely make purchasers take part in a psychological test or at least I would give an etiquette leaflet wit each single device, pointing out how to and how not to behave when using the freshly bought object.
But, unfortunately, as we all know, our world today is only about money, and when the money keeps rolling in, the "multies" do not care how people's lives will change, how more ignorant they will feel and how harsh and loud and impersonal this planet will become. It is up to the individuals to change. To make our world better, to teach our children better manners.
