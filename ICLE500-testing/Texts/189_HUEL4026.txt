Title: Mobile phones in public places

Nowadays mobile phones play an important role in many people's life, even children and elderly people seem to be acquainted with them. Wherever mobile-owners go, the phone is always on them, which, in itself, would not be a problem, but there are many cases when mobiles are not only unnecessary but also harmful and unethical, such as in public places. This is why mobile phones should be banned from public places.
Firstly, the social aspect of mobile usage should be taken into consideration. Mobile phones in public places such as restaurants, schools and cinemas are definitely embarrassing for other people. A lot of mobile-owners ignore the basic rules of etiquette which provide people with peaceful coexistence. This way those people who use their mobiles violate human rights, since they are not allowed to speak lovely in public places, although they do so since poor audibility makes it inevitable. This kind of misbehaviour appears in almost all public places, which requires the ban.
Secondly, according to psychological research, overusing mobile phones results n lack of constant concentration, oral fluency and lack of care about other people. Since public places are the ones where people develop and maintain their relationships and mobiles disallow them in this process, restriction on mobile phone usage could contribute to more vital interactions. Moreover, it is of high importance that children's and adolescents' social development should not be restricted by incompleted sentences and half-a-minute talks that mobile telephoning requires them to formulate.
In addiction to the social and psychological aspects, mobile-owners should not avoid considering mobile-usage as a physically harmful activity. There are several studies confirming the greater probability of brain disease among those people who use their mobiles more than five hours a day. Public transport, which is not a place as such, but could be linked to them since it is used just as often as public places, might be a source of danger for those who are exposed to micro - or radiowaves for they sit very close to one another. Besides that low-quality restaurants may cause similar damage.
However, there might be cases, when ban on mobile usage cannot be acceptable, such as emergency. Doctors and people whose job requires constant accessability are exceptions, although it should be taken into consideration that those people are just a minority. Generally, arguments against restrictions are not underlined, since there is no necessity in cases when people are involved in social activities.
As a conclusion, the widespread usage of mobile phones has created such a situation that requires an immediate action. Since loud telephoning violates the right for peaceful social social activities and both psychologically and physically harmful, a reasonable solution could be a ban of mobile usage in public places. Although there is a minority for whom it is inevitable, phone usage is not maintained in every case.
