Title: Mobile phones are bad for us

In the past few decades our world has changed beyond recognition. Thousands of inventions found their way to our homes. Especially the communicational technology has been developing quickly. For example, there is hardly anyone who does not own a mobile phone and cannot use it at least three times a day. The problem is that while many praise this invention, they often forget about the unwanted side affects of this communicational device. Mobile phones have caused negative changes in our behaviour and personality as well as in our personal relationships.
There are several examples which prove that mobile phones make us impatient, ignorant and even frustrated. Knowing that many people switch off their mobile phones only before they go to bed, many people do not care what time they call their friends or acquaintances. This, of course, can cause problems since many people forget to switch off their mobile phones when they should. Calling someone or receiving a call at an inconvenient time can be very frustrating and annoying for both the caller and for the called one. In addition, many people feel angry and become impatient when they cannot contact with a mobile phone owner who switched off his or her mobile phone, since for many it seems to be natural that mobile owners can always be reached on their phones.
Mobile phones have negative effects on our personal relationships as well. Owing to the high prices of the calling people tend to speak less in their mobile phones than they do at home in their telephones. Moreover, text messages allow us that we even do not have to speak to the one we want to contact with. Mobile phones, therefore, reduce both the quality and the quantity of our conversations which can have negative effects on our relationships.
Opponents of my position argue, that mobile phones are great inventions. They claim, that by using them people get to know each other more because we can use mobile phones more often than normal phones, so we get more information about our friends' and acquaintane's life. However, this is not entirely true. Since mobile phone conversations are not face-to-face contacts we do not gain many information about the one we talking to. In addition, many often think that phone calls substituds personal meetings, and they less and less often realize that they do not meet their friends.
To conclude, mobile phones are not as great inventions as one might think. They not only make us impatient and rude, but also can harm our relationships
