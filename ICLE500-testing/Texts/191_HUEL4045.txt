Title: Buying mobile phones for children under 14 is the parents' responsibility

Nowadays, we are overwhelmed with mobile phones, and we cannot imagine communication without them. During the last decades, they became inseparable from us as if they were part of our body. However, we seem to ignore the harmful effects caused by mobile phones. These phones, especially when used by children under a certain age, can damage the brain by changing the structure of neurons. In addition, children can easily become addicted to mobile phones which, in turn, will influence their achievement in school. Therefore, on my opinion, parents should not allow children under 14 to buy mobile phones.
There is a critical age for children, when their organs are most prone to be damaged. Under the age of 14 children's brains have not reached the developmental stage of an adult's brain, therefore they are more sensitive to the effects of mobile phones. According to several research studies carried out by medical universities, children, who used mobile phones before their fourteenth birthday, had serious mutation in their neurons which, in some cases, led to abnormal changes in their brains as well. Comparing these results with those of the control group, it was asserted that the neurons of the control group's members retained their original forms.
Besides the physiological effects of mobile phones, the psychological effects also play an important part in influencing children's life. In fact, psychological addiction can cause more damage in children's than physiological effects. For instance if a child takes up the habit of playing on his/her mobile phone all day then his/her attention will not be concentrated on his/her duties in school. As a result he/she will lag behind his/her schoolmates and this will worsen the chances in his/her later progress in school.
Parents, as the representatives of the opponent side may claim that it is useful to buy mobile phones for children even if these children are under fourteen because with the help of the phones children can be easily reached at any time. To a certain extent they may be right, however, their opinion can be debated. Few decades ago when mobile phones were even not heard of, parents knew about their children's location their programmes without the use of any technical device. In order to arrange such affairs such harmful means as mobile phones are not needed at all.
To sum up, it can be asserted that mobile phones are highly responsible for physiological as well as for psycological damage which endanger children who have not reached the age of fourteen and thus are the most sensitive to these effects. Thus, responsible parents who take into consideration their children's physical and mental health will not buy mobile phones for their children.
