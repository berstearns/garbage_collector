Title: Away with mobiles!

In today's digitalized and modernized society, where education is also based on modern technology, living without a mobile phone seems to be inconsiderable. As an increasing number of the young, including even kindergarten students is in the possession of a mobile, the fact that mobile communication is of paramount importance nowadays can clearly be seen. Though having a mobile can be useful in certain situations, the harmful effects of the untimely possession of one are also considerable. Therefore, the use of mobile phones should be banned in schools and other education centres.
An overwhelming majority of the scientists researching mobile radiation agree that the amount of radioactive waves a mobile phone emits is over the permitted limit. Such radiation is especially harmful for a body in development, so teenagers are more prone to be affected by it. As the parents seem to be negligent concerning this issue, it is the school who should take responsibility for the children's health.
In addition to the biological aspect, mobile phones possible cause certain social and psychological damage to undergraduates. As teenagers tend to judge their classmates on the basis of the financial circumstances of the latter a social hierarchy is established by the mobile phones they possess. Consequently, the privileged occupy a higher position in such a scale, irrespective of their internal features. Therefore, mobile phones contribute to the over emphasis of the external values, which probably causes moral decline among undergraduates.
Opponents of this position claim that, as social security shows a declining tendency nowadays, it is safer for the young to have a mobile phone with them. These researchers are partly tight in claiming that in case of a threatening attack a mobile phone on hand is certainly useful. However, when in real danger, one probably does not have the opportunity to use the phone.
In the majority of cases it is only the parents who feel safer because of their children's possessing a mobile. Furthermore, a brand - new mobile attracts the attention of juvenile delinquents as well, who 'specialize in ' stealing hi-tech devices. Consequently, mobile phones even endanger the security of undergraduates.
In sum, there should be an urgent ban on the use of mobile phones in school. As mobiles are harmful for an immature user from a biological, psychological and social aspect as well, a change in the attitude of the parents concerning this question would be required, and at the same time the responsibility of the school be emphasized. Therefore, the proclamation of the fact that mobile phones are harmful for undergraduates seems to be justified.
