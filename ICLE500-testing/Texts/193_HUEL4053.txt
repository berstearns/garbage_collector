Title: Should Mobile Phones Be Prohibited?

The rapid spread of technological devices is one of the greatest problems of our time.
The proper regulations regarding the use of these devices are still lacking. While many such instruments are silent and discreete, mobile phones can be disturbing, indeed. There are restrictions in theatres, cinemas, libraries, etc., however, it is considered to be a problem that many people use their mobile phones on means of public transportation. This problem could be solved, if the use of phones was prohibited on vehicles of public transportation.
As there are people who ignore regulations that are unwritten, these should be created on a legal basis. For this reason, a law should be passed, regulating the use of mobile phones, including and detailing, the restrictions of using mobile phones on means of transportation. Enforcing the regulations should be the common issue of local governments and the companies responsible for maintaining the public transportation systems.
While nearly everyone now owns a mobile phone, there is a large number of people who would renounce their use of these devices during the time spent on means of public transportation. Considering the opinion of both sides, it still remains true that the loud conversations, often related to the private life of the owner of the phone, are disturbing. The other travellers may consider this behaviour uncomfortable, inappropriate, and even uncouth. Meanwhile, it also takes away the privacy of the speaker's life, disclosing information that would not belong to public attention. This may cause psychological problems over a long time.
Besides these nervous problems, it has often been stated that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by devices, such as mobile phones, may have harmful effects on one's health. This concerns the owner of the phone, as well as those in their immediate surroundings. Even though this effect is not proven as fatal as the effect of active and passive smoking, the time available for the research has not been enough for a definite conclusion. The health hazard, however, should not be ignored, and it should be taken into consideration, when making a new regulation.
It can be cited. as a disadvantage that in our information-dependent society the prohibition of the use of mobile phones on means of public transportation will have negative effect on business life. This, however, is an exaggeration. The primary means of information transmission now rely more on local and global computer networks, as these provide users with more possibilities, while keep the level of redundancy and noise as low as possible. The partial prohibition of using mobile phones, while may be uncomfortable, will not cause severe problems.
Considering the arguments for and against introducing a prohibition of mobile phones on means of public transportation, while the possible problems are clear to all, the step is needed, and should be taken. This would later be supplemented by additional solutions, but the advancing of modern technology requires immediate regulations regarding these devices.
