Title: Mobile phones are ruining privacy

The technology of mobile phones has developed greatly in the last fifteen years. The improvement is still continuing and the use of these objects has spread like wildfire. By now almost everybody owns a cellphone. It can be seen in the hands of tiny school children as well as in their grandparents! Of course, mobiles have disadvantages too. Some doctors claim that the radiation of the electromagnetic waves these phone work with may cause heart attack. What is even more threatening, is how mobiles effect people's daily life. Privacy is seriously endangered by the constant presence of cellphones.
On one hand, companies are to blame. Managers very often demand non-stop accessibility from their employees. This means that workers have to take their mobiles home and they are not allowed to switch them off even at night. This is not only disturbing the employee but his or her family as well. If the person is called at night, the ringing wakes up at least his/her partner or, in worse case, the children as well.
Companies are not taking into consideration that their employees have a life outside the office, which should not be so. People should be allowed to switch off their phones at least in the night hours.
On the other hand, mobile users create the problems themselves, even if unconsciously. Many people are addicted to their mobiles and they are not aware how this might affect others in their environments. By owning the mobile some people gain the - sometimes fake - feeling of importance. Since they cannot bear missing a call or a text message, these people carry their phones along with them everywhere - even to the toilet. This is a wrong attitude. They should realize that not looking at their cellphones every second will certainly not result in catastrophe.
But even very important persons (doctors, for instance) should think about the people around them, when they are making or receiving calls or messages. Often they rudely answer unimportant calls in the middle of a conversation or a consultation. This immediately makes the partner or patient feel bad, because it gives them a feeling that their speech is not as valuable and worth continuing as the phone call. Most likely nobody would appreciate it if a third person came and interrupted their discussion. Private calls at working time should be thought of the same way.
To sum up, mobile phones mean an increasing threat to people's private life. Be it the company or the owners of phones themselves who decide not to switch the mobile off, the constant use of cellphones might harm one or more people's intimacy and privacy. This is an unhealthy situation and people should realize that sometimes instead of paying attention to the mobile they should pay more attention to their environment.
