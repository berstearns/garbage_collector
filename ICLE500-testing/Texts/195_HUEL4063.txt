Title: Mobile phone use should be strictly controlled at workplaces.
 
Mobile phones are considered to be one of the most important means of communication, as they facilitate everyday life by making everything easily accessible. Unfettered mobile phone use, however, have several disadvantageous consequences especially at workplaces where the question of restriction is still to be solved. Mobile phone use should be strictly controlled at workplaces by adapting mobile etiquette guidelines, because thoughtless telephoning can draw employees' attention away from work, as well as disturb other employees, and ruin social contacts.
First of all, unrestricted mobile phone use by employees can result in the falling behind with their duties, since those workers who are occupied with making telephone calls and sending or receiving text messages all day long can hardly pay attention to their tasks. Failing to live up to the expectations of their employees, however, might result in losing their job. By the restriction of mobile phone use to a certain number of calls, workers could be obliged to fulfil their duties more efficiently.
Moreover, with their constant telephoning, mobile users might disturb their colleagues as well, thus depriving them of the opportunity to complete that task successfully. The ringing of mobile phones can also be very disturbing during business meetings as well, because they might interrupt the continuous progress of the live conversation.
Disregarding other people's duties can be considered as a highly unethical and selfish behaviour which could only be changed by the imposing of a code of mobile etiquette on the workers
Thirdly, unfettered mobile phone use posesses the power of ringing social contacts, since those who are engrossed with telephoning tend to neglect traditional forms of communication such as one-on-one conversation. Workers usually fail to pay attention to their colleagues because of constant telephoning and thus deprive themselves from the opportunity of effective co-operation. The lack of personal contacts might bad to irreversible consequences such as the alienation of mobile users from their colleagues. This could be prevented by the initiation of a code of mobile etiquette.
Many people claim that mobile phones play such and important role in today's world that the use of them is impossible to be restricted. It should be understood, however, that in certain situations it is inevitable to put barriers before unfettered mobile phone use in order to preserve traditional norms of behaviour. Only by the implementation of etiquette guidelines could selfish behaviour be prevented at workplaces.
In conclusion, although mobile phones has numerous advantages which make their use inevitable in today's world, their spreading and unfettered use should be restricted in certain situations. As the thoughtless use of them might result in unwanted consequences regarding the behaviour of employees and also the atmosphere of the workplace, it should be strictly controlled by a code of mobile etiquette. The initiation of such etiquette guidelines would be inevitable in all companies in the near future.
