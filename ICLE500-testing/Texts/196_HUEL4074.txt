Title: Mobile phones - disconnecting people

Cell phones with internet access are the smash hits of today because they enable lazy people to keep up relatively good relationships with others in strictly 160 characters, or a few minutes chatting per day. The reason why this is accepted is this "running world we live in nowadays." Since most of the people do not complain about the impersonality of mobile phones, the most private and prescious things are communicated through these devices. This leads to the excessive use of cell phones which only results in people growing apart.
Even though the mobile companies claim they help people stay in touch, they do exatly the opposite and further more they create cell phone addicts. The ads everywhere about the brilliance of new phones makes people believe that they are only important and lobed of they get texts and picture messages every day. People are deceived into believing that a few seconds of typing show care, and that mobile devices are capable of transferring feelings.
Thus, they are not afraid of carrying out the most important conversations through mobile phones. Unfortunate√©y, however, the little machines tend to run out of batteries right in the middle of these most prescious discussions leading to horrible misunderstandings and arguments. All because of people trusting networks and machines more then each other.
We should remember that cellphones are meant to be last resorts and not a substitution for real - life relationships and conversations. In fact, texts and chats do give hundreds of opportunities to carry out white lies which will surely go unnoticed. You cannot hear the voice of the sender, you do not see the face, and the place he/she might be at. For example, a text message to the worrying parents such as "I am fine, at my friends place" coming form a pub, typed by a friend while the supposed sender is lying passed out, will save the mobile owner a family argument on alcohol, but without doubt makes parents and child grow further apart.
To add a different aspect, I would like to mention that the limited number of words in chats and texts lead to further problems in relationships or even business matters. Senders tend to gain space and time by leaving out words such as ' please ' and ' thank you ' which makes texts rude, and more impersonal, if possible. This is an aspect proving that mobile communication was originally meant for help in cases of emergency and not for solving family matters or carrying out complete business conversations.
To sum it up, I believe that mobile communication is not the right means to keep in touch with one's loved ones because it is highly impersonal and deceptive, these networks and devices cannot be trusted, and the features of texts and chat enable people too easily to lie. Furthermore the limited number of characters makes these messages way too much to the point and often very rude. Therefore, we should tresure mobile communication as a huge help when in emergency, and carry out our personal and business matters face-to-face; no matter how old-fashioned it might sound.
