Title: Mobile phones: blessing or curse?

The phenomenon of mobile phones has been around for decades. At first, we looked at them with aroused curiousity, now we see them whenever we look, and cannot imagine our life without them. Still, the question arises whether they make our life easier and more comfortable or whether they make us become nervous wrecks. Some argue for them, some against but, I believe, they are rather harmful than beneficial.
Firstly, it is not only our own mobile phone that can annoy us but also that of other people. Though some of the ringtones are enjoyable, many to them are so unpleasant that it is difficult to bear them. We have to endure them on trains, buses and trams no matter how loud or disturbing they are. And it is not only the ringtone that we have to tolerate but also the conversation that follows it. It was unbelievable for me. At least for a while, that certain people are completely uninterested in the fact that I am listening to their most intimate conversations.
Secondly, the harmful effects of mobile phones on our health are proved by scientists. Experts carried out several experiments and it came to light that mobile phones can cause cancer in several parts of the body. At the sae time, they have a bad effect on our psyche as, because of them, many people suffer from tension.
Thirdly, we should not forget about the effects of mobile phones on schools. There seem to be a mobile phone boom in the secondary but also in the elementary schools. Lessons are often disturbed by children taking photographs of their teacher or punching the buttons of their mobiles; even though they are not allowed to use mobile phones in the territory of the school. I must admit that this can be the teachers' fault if they are not strict enough. Still, I believe, this form of disruptive behaviour would not exist if there were no mobile phones.
Finally, the intimacy of family dinners seem to evaporate since the members of the family rather talk to their friends on their mobile phones that to each other. Also the sight of a father walking his son and making a phone conversation at the same time is familiar. Some claim that mobile phones are vital because they help us to keep in contact with our family members, but I really do not see it like that, the reason for this is that, on the one hand, it is quite expensive to call somebody on the phone who is abroad. On the other hand, people seem to forget the good old days when they had sent letters to each other. In my view, this is a serious mistake, as a letter is always more intimate, personal and longer than an sms.
All in all, I think, it can be concluded that mobile phones cause more strain and pain than happiness. They not only ruin family life but also make the work of teachers more difficult, ruin our health, an cause tension when used in public.
