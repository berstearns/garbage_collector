Title: Mobile etiquette should be introduced at workplaces

A lot of companies complain nowadays that the lack of a properly frameworked mobile etiquette is ruining their lives and working efficiency. They claim that a rulebook of the accessibility and usage of any mobile device would be necessary. In my opinion, it would solve many outstanding personnel-connected problems, so it is definitely needed. However, the issue is a controversial one and as attracted a lot of debate.
First and foremost, the fact that anybody's mobile phone can ring at any time and at any moment is bothering in itself. He or she, then, has to stop doing the thing they were doing and starting off again needs much more effort, energy and time than simply finishing the task in a manner that is suitable for the purpose.
Another very important aspect of interruption is that it also prevents meetings, discussions and talks from going on in a normal way. Thus, people not only hinder their own work but others' too.
In some cases the ringing of a mobile phone can be dangerous as well. Some jobs and professions require much more presence and attention than others. The sudden throbbing or "screaming" (one can hear such terrible ringtones) of a mobile gadget may const lives: imagine working at the top of high buildings or a surgeon operating on someone. These may be isolated, extreme examples but their occurrence is said to be more and more common nowadays.
However, a lot of people claim that using a mobile phone any time and anywhere they want can be crucial. They say that if a mobile usage (or what is more a receive-signal) restriction were to introduced, emergency calls could not be made immediately. Nevertheless, these people tend to forget or do not know that telecommunication service providers can easily make the network capable of anyone being able to make an emergency call anywhere, any time.
It has also been stated by people who disagree with the introduction of the etiquette that with a possible restriction of usage, important calls (especially incoming ones) would be lost. As it is impossible to distinguish between important and unimportant incoming calls, they say that a placement of a total bar on incoming calls would mean a huge risk for companies losing essential business partners. The weakest point of this argument, however, is that if nobody is allowed to use their mobile phones at certain conditions, nobody will miss any calls. It can easily be understood that, statistically, if there are fewer outgoing calls, there are fewer incoming ones too.
All in all, the solution of the problem may be either a limitation of signal or limitation of usage. Once we lived in a world where no gadget threatened the moment and nobody stopped doing important tasks for the sake of a phonecall. Maybe we should find that again.
