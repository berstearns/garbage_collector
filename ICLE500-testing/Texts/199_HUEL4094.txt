Title: Mobile phones: more of a curse than a blessing

Mobile phones are only a recent invention but in the course of a few short years they have managed to become a part of almost all of our lives. Everybody has them, everybody uses them - on the bus, in the park, at the workplace - even at home or on a date. We have fulfilled a long-desired goal of mankind: we are always instantly accessible. But what is the price we have to pay? Instead of bringing people closer, mobile phones have, at least in most people's lives, managed to separate us from those who really matter: our loved ones, our friends and family.
Firstly, mobile phones are like any other electrical device in one respect if we have them, we will unavoidably start using them more and more, much more than we would really need to. We may promise ourselves that we will only use our mobile when really necessary, but after a while we will invariably notice ourselves calling other at all times of the day to discuss matters that we could, in some mysterious manner, solve without a mobile earlier. And thus our mobile will begin to take up more and more of our time, and more and more of the time of the people that we call.
Furthermore, the moment we require instant accessibility any time, we have already sacrificed part of our privacy: we have let business calls and calls from acquaintances into our private life reserved for our family and friends. The phone may ring any moment and ruin our most special and precious moments, but we dare not switch it off - who know what we'd miss if we did.
After all, what good is a mobile if we are not reachable 24 hours of the day?
Finally, after a time people tend to get addicted to the "buzz" of constant phone calls, no matter how bothersome they may find them otherwise. We may curse our friends or business associated when they keep ringing us all the time, but when they don't when we switch on our mobile and find no new calls no new messages we feel left-out, lonely, insignificant. We start to measure our importance, our popularity, even the extent to which we are loved - in phonecalls.
In conclusion, mobile phones, contrary to our hopes of always being there for everyone, distance us from our nearest and dearest. The problem lies in the goal itself: the great promise of mobile phones, instant accessability, means that we have no more time that is only reserved for us and the ones that we love; and also, unavoidably, when we have reached our goal and yet no one wants to access us, we feel disappointed, sometimes even to the extent of forgetting about the people who are there for us in person.
