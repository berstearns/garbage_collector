Title: Mobile phones in elementary and secondary schools

It is common knowledge that communication devices, such as mobile phones, laptops, computers provided with internet access are present ubiquitously in our lives. Also, our communication habits have undergone considerable change since we tend to communicate, with each other more via communication devices than face to face. Furthermore, the widespread use of the high-tech communication devices affects not only universities and colleges but also elementary and secondary schools. For a variety of reasons, I strongly believe that the use of mobile phones should be prohibited in elementary and secondary schools.
First of all, I am convinced that it should be prohibited to use mobile phones in elementary and secondary schools because the use of mobile phones puts the teacher to considerable inconvenience. On one hand, it disturbs classroom work since students' attention tend to get distracted and flag by sending text messages to each other or playing games on their phones. Additionally, it is highly time-consuming for the teacher to constantly remind students to turn off their mobiles before every single lesson. Likewise, mobile phones are gateway to new cheating techniques in the exams and in-class test, which is also highly difficult for the teacher to cope with.
In a similar rein, the widespread use of mobile phones in schools may also result in the proliferation of school thefts. I strongly believe that the modern, high-tech mobiles are a temptation to those who are liable to pickpocketing. Thus, the use of mobile phones lead to the in-school not only economical damage of the student's family but to the fading of the morality of the school.
Therefore, I would prohibit to use mobile phones in schools because it not only hardens the teacher's work but also tends to damage the morality of the school.
Furthermore, the widespread use of mobile phones results in the students' social differentiation. I am convinced that students whose parents are not so well off to afford to buy expensive mobile phones for their children may face exclusion and bullying within the class. Therefore, allowing all students to use their mobile phones in the class environment breeds considerable psychological pressure for those of humble origins, particularly students n elementary school. It is common knowledge that students at the age from 6 to 14 are unable to cope with outside attacks and criticism. Therefore, bullying and exclusion causes them longlasting damage, which at a certain extent due to the fact that they do not prossess the type of mobile phones their peer pressure requires of them.
On the other hand, I would eliminate mobile phones from schools, root and branch because of their supposedly harmful effects on human body. In fact, most recently the issue of the radiation of electronic devices, including mobile phones has been a political hot potato. Since there has not been revealed any conclusive evidence that proves that the radiation of mobile phones is not harmful. Schools put students' health at considerable risk. Since one of the aims of schools is to provide a secure and fertile territory for the students' development the permission to use mobile phones is highly inconsiderate.
In contrast, it is also a widespread opinion that schools are supposed to be the reflection of the real world, thus schools are encouraged to provide the same facilities and circumstances of the outside world. In this respect, many people are convinced that students should be provided with the most recent innovations not only at home but also in schools. They argue that the use of mobile phones is essential if schools wish to prepare them to cope with the outside world. However, I strongly object to the promotion of mobile phones in schools because students can already acquire all the necessary technical skills at home, since they have a wealth of communication devices at their disposal.
All in all, I am convinced that elementary and secondary schools should be encouraged to prohibit the use of mobile phones. On one hand, the ubiquitous presence and use of mobile phones makes the teacher's work difficult due to their time-consuming duties. More concretely, mobile phones distract students' attention and offer them new cheating techniques, which are difficult to overcome for a teacher. Additionally, schools may face more thefts among students. Ultimately, mobile phones may cause lasting damage in human body. Therefore, it is highly irresponsible for schools to expose students to an electronic device that has the potential to cause damage.
