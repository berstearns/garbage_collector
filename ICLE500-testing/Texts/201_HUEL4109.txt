Title: Mobile phones should be banned

In our high-tech society mobile devices have achieved a great importance. Lately wireless phones have become ivailable parts of our daily routine. We usually feel lost without a phone at hand: we do not know the birthdays of our parents, we cannot recall our business appointment or we cannot contact our friends. Mobiles supervise, control and register each minute of our lives, we suffer from mobile-addiction. Therefore, suggest that mobile phones should be banned.
Firstly, the use of mobiles should be forbidden so that we could regain the sacredness of the private life. If we take a bus or we just walk along the Danube, we are forced to over hear other people's problems and details of their private lives. Mobile users do not seem to respect privacy of other people and that of their own. Furthermore, we are burdened not only with their intimacy but we should be always afraid that someone will call us and we will be in the same impolite situation. A mobile phone can ring at anytime and any where, thus we cannot feel safe and secure as it can break any harmonious moment of our lives.
Secondly, the ban of mobile phones would reduce the number of accidents. Car drivers will not turn off their mobiles when sit in their cars. Statistics, however, show that a large number of accidents is due to the use of mobile phones in the course of car-driving. Communication via mobile phone usually takes away the driver's attention that results in serious accidents. Therefore, we could conclude that if there is no mobile, there will be no accident.
Thirdly, many people say that mobile phones have become the symbols of the social status. The latest model of the equipment you have, the highest social position you are considered to be in. Therefore, many people spend a fortune in order to obtain the most recent mobile phone and keep up with the fashion world. Unfortunately, this process has appeared among young children, too. More and more parents are forced to buy mobile phones for their children, though they could not afford them. Mobile has become one of the gadgets that we should buy according to market-manipulating mobile producing companies, though we could easily live without it.
Many people say that mobiles rather ease than suppress or lives as these devices can prove to be useful when we lack time it is true that mobiles have advantages when we are in hurry, but we would not be hurry if we did not have mobile devices. In my opinion these wireless equipment are the cause of the acceleration of our world. We cannot slow down until we employ them.
To sum up, we can conclude that mobile phones destroy the privacy and intimacy of our lives. We are in constant stress whether our mobile phones will ring or not. Furthermore, statistics show that the use of mobiles increases the number of accidents on the roads. Finally, mobiles have become fashion devices and people spend much money to buy a new model. All these disadvantages of mobile phones, in spite of their advantages, suggest that mobiles should be banned from everyday life.
