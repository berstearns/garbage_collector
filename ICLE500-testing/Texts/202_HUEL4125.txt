Title: Mobile phones: useful but dangerous

Today in the 21st century nearly every person has got a mobile phone, even little children at elementary school. Everybody has got an opinion about mobile phones but even if this opinion is negative people cannot stop using them. Mobile phones are important for the life of modern people but they should not be essential. It is clearly to be stated that people should try to reduce the usage of their mobile phones because it has a negative effect on their lifestyle, on their human relationships and on their health.
First of all, due to the advantages of mobile phones such as mobility and long lasting accumulators one can be connected at every time of the day, however, this may turn into the state of being checked and supervised by everybody, for example by the colleagues form the company or by the members of the family. This state is likely to make the person in question nervous and irritated and his or her lifestyle is likely to be directed by other people with the help of the mobile phone.
Furthermore, due to the fact that phone operators offer phone calls for a little amount of money people tend to make phone calls instead of talking to people personally. This reduces the intensity of the relationships because one can communicate far more information during a personal intercourse with gestures, looks and even with clothes and hairstyle than during a simple phone call. Thus, people are losing the ability of personal communication because during a phone call it has no importance what the speaker is actually doing.
The third crucial factor which is to be considered in connection with mobile phones is health. Mobile phones have a negative effect on people's health from two poinst of view. Firstly, one can be addicted to the usage of the mobile phone in a way that the person is only feeling happy and contented if there is a message coming or somebody is calling. People who depend as much on their phone are not able to have a quiet, peaceful rest which is also harmful to their health. Secondly, it has been proved that the constant noise of the speakers is harmful to the ear of the listener especially when the phone is turned on a loud modus for the sake of being able to hear the speaker while travelling on the bus or on the train. In addition, due to this loud modus other travellers are likely to hear all parts of the conversation which might be irritating to them.
As a conclusion it can be stated that people who use their mobile phones too much are likely to have a hectic and restless lifestyle, lose the ability of personal communication and threaten their health. Therefore they should reduce the usage of their mobile phones. However, unless technical development does not slow down, people will not do so. Nobody knows where this process is leading to.
