Title: Mobile etiquette should be enforced by law

Recently debates concerning the use of cell phones in public places have become more and more popular. However, the debates remain still debates, and they have not provided a solution for the problem of regulation yet. The establishment of a unfied mobile etiquette is considerably urgent, though. As instructions and advice have not proved to be effective enough, the etiquette and regulation of mobile phone using in public places has to be necessarily enforced by law for moral, security and healthily reasons.
First and the foremost, the prohibition of mobile phones form public places by law is morally important. Public places as theatres, cinemas, concert halls and schools are rarely respected by mobile - addicted people. They do not consider other people's entertainment important enough to switch or at least mute their cell-phones. Consequently a kind and polite callingof their attention to do so is not sufficient. Mobiles' prohibition should be fulfilled by law and also strengthen by the possibility of financial punishment.
Secondly, the lawful enforcement of the mobile etiquette is enourmously important for public security. Cell phones are already prohibited during driving vehicles, but it is also hazardous to use them during public transportation. Receiving or starting a phone call, or even reading text messages highly require peoples' attention and they cannot concentrate on invisible and dangerous factors of traffic. Mobile phones often lead to accidents, even to lethal ones. A phone call is sometimes more important than the security of someone's own life.
Another significant aspect of the issue concerns health. Using mobile phones in public places like hospitals and other social institutes of health care is not only prohibited and impolite but also very dangerous. Still there are people who are indifferent to the prohibition. Forbiding the phone calls by law would prevent disasters of pace-makers' interference with mobile phones and generally would provide a more pleasant environment in hospitals, which is essential for the patients' recovery.
Opponents of this position argue that the enforcement of mobile etiquette by law is not only unnecessary but also impossible to apply. It is necessarily difficult to carry out a lately developed ruling against the accommodated habitation, still laws of the nation have their considerably great effect on public acting.
A law is always more powerful than an advice, an instruction or a rule. Regarding the issue of mobile etiquette and the attempts that are made to enforce it is public places, the only solution available is the lawful regulation. Prohibition of cell-phones from public places provides people healthier, safer and morally more appropriate life.
