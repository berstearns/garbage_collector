Title: Mobile Etiquettes Are Urgently Needed

That employees make long phone calls on their mobile phones discussing either their private lives or managing their usual everyday affairs is a well-known fact, unfortunately. These kind of phone calls disturb others while they are trying hard to concentrate on their work. This insufferable situation is due to the fact that no etiquette concerning the adequate and proportionate use of mobile phones has been established at workplaces yet. Therefore, every workplace, company and office should formulate a detailed eituette regarding the use of cellular phones so that employees would not make each other's work performance decline.
Most importantly, by establishing and applying a set of rules restricting the use of mobiles at workplaces the quality of work could be sustained and improved effectively. If there are no redundant mobile calls during work a greater adherence to work and the elimination of phases of milder concentration on the part of employees will both be achieved. This will result in a more successful business management.
In addition to the enhancement of business management, creating a mobile phone etiquette would also lead to ameliorated collegial relationships since everyone would have to take their peers' interests into consideration as well as regards the use of cellulars. Thus, heated debates on the topic would cease because everyone would obey the established rules. As a consequence, cooperation among colleagues would be fostered, and several new friendships may also develop.
It might be argued, however, that such a restricting etiquette is inherently confusing and disorienting since there are quite a few borderline situations at a workplace when it is almost impossible to decide whether responding to a particular call violates the etiquette. Moreover, in such situations one must make a decision within a few seconds, which might not be enough for estimating and anticipating the exact nature of a call, which then also needs to be compared to the points defined in the etiquette. While this is undoubtedly true, it ought to be realised that on the whole the advantages outweigh the mentioned disadvantages; after contemplating all the possible aspects of mobile phone rules, it seems reasonable to claim that in the case of properly defined guidelines employees and employers alike will surely face fewer disturbing or even embarrassing situations related to the improper use of cellular phones than in the case of entirely lacking such rules. The lack of a mobile etiquette would eventually lead to frustrations and a tense atmosphere at any workplace. Hence, mobile phone regulations should be applied at workplaces for the benefit of all the people working there.
In conclusion, it might be stated that a detailed set of rules concerning the use of cellular phones needs to be defined at every workplace since it is the only way to guarantee the high standard and the quality of work. Not only will such rules help to preserve high quality work performance but they will also improve collegial relationships and the atmosphere of the workplace.
