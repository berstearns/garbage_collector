Title: Mobile communication - 'connecting people'?

Nowadays hi-tech gadgets aiming at better communication and more intense interpersonal relations abound around us. One is apparently available whenever, wherever he may be. However, by peeping under this perfect image on the surface, one might find that the fine-sounding initiatives have backfired. In my opinion, the worldwide spread of mobile communication devices did not only result in positive effects but also in extremely impersonal communicative methods and in splintering sociability.
First and foremost, the impersonality of the most popular electronic communication tools hinders the basically personal aspect of this process. It is most visible in the case of text messages and e-mails, where only digital signs and small machines convey the information. This apparent distance allows us to express ourselves more freely, neglecting the usual codes of conduct, in terms of communicative methods. That is the reason why we appear to be ruder due to these technological advances. Letters written by hand still involve personal involvement, therefore the aforementioned distance does not have such grave effects . 
Besides these written forms, the seemingly interactive phonecalls lack important features of one-on-one conversations, including the use of the devices of non-verbal communication. The ever widening range of emoticons attempts to compensate for this deficiency in the case of e-mails and text messages. Though phonecalls provide the vocal tools of non-verbal communication, the lack of visual and gesture-involving ones often nears the efficiency of these conversations. It is for these reasons that I consider modern communication devices impersonal, thus inappropriate for their aims.
Apart from the impersonal trait, the mobile devices often distort the existing social relations of the individual. Instead of concentrating on the events ' here and now', many indulge in the relations distant maintained via e-mail or mobile phone. Interrupting an on-going conversation thanks to a call or the arrival of a message is a familiar scene to all of us. As for me, I often find myself in front of the computer (where time seems to fly) typing a mail for hours, while I could spend my precious time for more ' live ' communications, too, for example talking to my family with whom it would be more important and nonetheless, more easy. This feature of focusing on ' there and then ' instead of the current situation is also a disadvantage of the theoretically sociable process of mobile communication.
However, many argue that the advantages of cell phones and widespread Internet use outnumber the disadvantages. They claim that immediate and constant access of people made life easier in problem-solving and that detached relatives and friends can bridge the geographical gap almost entirely. Though their point is reasonable in some special cases, in my point of view the ' intimate zone ' of the individual, and his right to be alone and ' unavailable ' is infringed this way.
As it has been mentioned, the technological advances in the field of mobile communication has resulted in positive effects, in many aspects. Nevertheless, I beleive that the principal aim (as it is included in a slogen of a cell phone manufacturer) to connect people is not achieved completely, since the use of mobile communication devices encourages impersonal communication and a neglect of living, existing personal relations.
