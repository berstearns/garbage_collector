Title: Mobile phones used more intelligently

Nowadays, almost everyone has a mobile phone and one is not surprised to hear a mobile ringing on a bus or tram. However, it is very disturbing if someone is phoning loudly on a means of transport. Mobiles ringing during a lecture or a seminar or in the middle of an intimate conversation can be even more annoying. Unfortunately, being late is not considered so badly nowadays because one can always postpone the appointment by sending a text message. Taking all these into consideration, a more intelligent use of mobile phones should be encouraged in our rushing hi-tech world.
Firstly, it is very disturbing if someone is communicating on his mobile very loudly on a bus or tram. Lots of people have to travel through the city every day to reach their workplace or their school. Some of them use the time of travelling for reading, studying or even trying to rest. Being forced to listen to someone's conversation because it is so loud, violates their human rights. It should be forbidden to talk on the phone loudly on the means of public transport.
Secondly, it is also very disturbing if a mobile phone rings during a lecture or a seminar at university. Although, it is common knowledge that students should switch off their mobiles when attending a lecture or a seminar, it is not important enough for them. During my university years there were several occasions when someone forgot to switch off his mobile and in the middle of the lesson it started to ring loudly. It was even worse when the person whose phone rang could not find his mobile easily and it continued to ring for several seconds. It should be taken more seriously to switch off one's mobiles before going to a lecture or a seminar.
Finally, when one is involved in an intimate conversation and his mobile rings, the other person may feel very disappointed. It can be interpreted as a lack of respect if one starts talking on the phone with someone else while the original co-converser is waiting for the continuation of the conversation.
Using a mobile can be considered a very good device if one has an appointment and wants to postpone it because of being late. However, it is much likely to be late if one knows that he can send a text message to postpone the appointment. Probably, if one did not have this possibility, one would be more punctual.
In conclusion, there are several occasions in one's life when it is indisputable that mobiles are not used properly. Talking loudly on a means of transport or mobiles ringing during a lecture or seminar can be very disturbing. Moreover, starting to talk to someone else on the phone during a one-to-one conversation or postponing more and more appointments by sending a text message can be a sign of lack of respect. We should learn to use our mobile phones more intelligently.
