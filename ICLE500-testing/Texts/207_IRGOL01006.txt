Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

Most university degrees are theoretical and don't prepare students for the real world. They are of little value.
I agree with this subject but even with such a situation students shouldn't give up. Education is taking a big step in our life. In the ways to cross the bridge from the teen years into adulthood, we all we'll have to get ready for the real life, so even if our educational system doesn't prepare us we should take care of it ourselves. For example, part time jobs-extra university activities-having and lecture can be very helpful.
Part time jobs: It's a very effective way which can prepare you to work in the future only if you don't miss your classes. The aim of having a part time job is not just to earn money.
Extra university activities: with working on extra programs you'll improve your motivation. Writing a paper would help you and inventing is so useful too. It is not important that how great is your paper or how cool is your invention, the only important thing is trying, because trying makes you better and batter, so just keep trying.
Have a lecture: There are many jobs which needs having a good speech, having self confidence and managing the situation such as a translator or a teacher; therefore, a lecture can help you improve yourself and get ready for the real world because it makes you more experience.
Experience is a big issue. It is one of the biggest problems for those students who want to start working. An educational system should prepare student for the real world, but a theoretical educational system can't do it, so I recommend a practical educational system in which students will get more experience.
In a practical educational system students won't be just studding their books. Actually they will be more active. They will experience their lessons and they can feel the things they'll learn. Feeling things is different from reading things. When students feel the things they learn, they usually won't forget it though in theoretical educational system lessons will be forgotten soon.
Pragmatic courses can make students more experience too, but unfortunately these kinds of tests are not used in our country too much. In many of the countries in the world a class is just a room, but it should be more than that. A class should be a place more than a room with boards and benches. It must be a place of thinking, creating, acting, making, communicating and inventing.
Why most of the countries won't change their educational system from theoretical to practical?
1 economical problems
2 it needs more facilities
3 it requires a great change in the way of teaching
The problem is not just university degrees, the problem is the whole educational system which should be totally changed from the primary school to high school and to collage. Theoretical knowledge is important but without practical knowledge it is not useful at all. A good educational system will teach student things more that math, physics and literature. Actually it influence their all life and thought. It can turn a little child to a creature and reasonable man, so the educational system should be the first program of each government.
