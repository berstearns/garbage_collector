Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

Learning must be based academic study and practical work experience providing them for jobs. Learning experiences provide for the student to use and combine theoretical knowledge gained in academic students to real work .
work place practical experiences, and to fit the student for the student for a job with professional skills .

	I agree about this topic, at first, the educational experiences are not involving the students at first and their learning not very high and the time they spend on task disappointingly low. they may employee with disconnected course that it be thought in university. some organizations will not be able to consider an extended work experience or on suitable work space to do the student project, it is wonder that students seem so uninvolved in learning. their learning experiences are not very involving. students are more likely to persist and graduate in setting that foster learning. learning has always been the key to student persistence. students are actively involved in learning, that is who spend more time on task, are more likely to learn and, in turn, more likely to stay and gradute .
the second, students should recognize their responsibilities to their carrier, the public and the occasion pace with .
they should he interested in working when dealing with their job it is important that the student considers a perfecl program of experiences and responsibilities within the organizatin to the placement and keeps its although students should be fit to take on duties of their projects. if the student already works within the organization, they should recognize a specified project whit the focus of their placement. students are expected to practice their professional, behavioral and technical skill to the best of their ability. third, support is a condition that improve student success. research shows to three types of support that improve success acodemic, social and financial. above academic support, unfortunately many of students don't study sirusly and they should be support for education courses, study groups and academic support programs such as perfect instruction is an important condition in the university. And also about socail support in the form of counseling and ethnic student centers. such centers provide much support every students and a safe for all of students when they find themseleves out of place. perfect instruction, for example provides academic support that is connected to a specefic class to help students succeed in that class .
at the end, learning should integrate with communication skills professional networks, industry & business knowledge and personal organization along education enhence, students should discover new possibilities offered by work integrated learning .
