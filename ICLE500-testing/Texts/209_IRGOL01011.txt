Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

In today world, education is one of the essential factors for being successful in life. Most people try to go to universities for obtaining a degree and being a literate person. Nearly a lot of people today believe that the key to successful life or an occupation is the quality of education but unfortunately nowadays most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world so they are therefore of little values. As a matter of fact, I completely agree with this issue and in the following paragraphs I explain why I'm agree about this issue .
At first, one question is considered, by obtaining a university degree are the students prepared for the real world? It is important to note that life outside the walls of university is distinctive. So it needs a skill and the ability to adapt to environment. When the students enroll in universities, they expect to gain knowledge and also the practical skills that they will need for their future .universities should prepare students for future work not just giving them theoretical concept about their majors. But unfortunately recent studies shows that universities fail to prepare students to a life after graduation. For example in accounting major instead of teaching students theoretical concepts. Universities must improve their communication skills and also their critical thinking for their real world so that they can be really skillful in their major .
Secondly, by passing the time peoples expectation is getting higher because they want to embrace new innovations and technologies. Future is waiting for the people who are creative and competitive. However; universities need to concentrate on the areas to prepare the students for the real world. The first one is improving the classroom. For example by equipping the classroom with the technology that is necessary for student training, we give them a chance to acquaint with this thing when they enter the real world. For example by equipping the classroom in mechanic major the students should know the latest technologies that can help them in their future work and on the other hand if they don't learn the practical concepts they can't begin a valuable job in future .
Thirdly, professors must be qualified and proficient in the subject or skills they are about to teach. The teacher who knows nothing about a subject cannot effectively teach students. They must employ professionals for their expertise. For example in English institution the teachers must be able to communicate with the target language. The teacher attempt to use a method that attracts the students when he or she teaches .
At last, I said that there are some factors that cause universities concentrate more on the practical things. I hope that universities change the process of their teaching that we can have a better life. A nation's future depends on the quality of workers it produces, Workers who are the students that well-equipped with knowledge and skills that universities prepare them .
