Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

When students first register in university, they begin a new section of their life, they should know they will encounter a completely new style of learning and acquiring lessons. The students, who have a perfect background in their new field of study, must have been more successful than other students. I completely disagree with the topic, because education is never null. I think it depends on the students view of how they think about the value of university, they interest in their field, they knowledge about chances in university, and their effort to achieve their goals.
	First thing is how a student thinks about university? Does university degree won't be theoretical and useless for his life world and his future life. He can also apply what he had learned, in his conduct and social skill. Although some people think there is no value in studying in university, but the fact is another thing and it would completely change a man's behavior, lifestyle, and point of view . 
Interest is another factor which helps students to be as successful as possible in their future. If a student is interested in his field of study he could be able to do his best and be prepared for the real world and utilizes what he had learned, in his vocation, by going to university and acquiring new subjects he could know better what he can do by what he got form education.
In addition to value of university and interests of students, as we know university stands a chance of doing something. Little knowledge in a major which a student sees a lifelong ambition in it and a daunting challenge will guarantee success. Nowadays, people do not pay respect to degree. They'll look at his remarkable achievements on what he is sure to do it, i means his proficiency, something that he has been skilled in. University, is a place where students rise above problems in their lessons, investigations, (etc.). There is a strong chance of learning new methods. It is a place where he can develop right personal qualities, learn misleading information and further more try hardly to compile them. Lack of knowledge is never admirable but, knowledge is not enough to make money. University will give him the chance and motivation. It's his duty to work out depend on the major, knowledge he could also studies different books and resources during his university period to learn and urgent and unexpected problems and do his best to tackle it and end in failure in a real life style. He is hardly likely to strengthen motivation in work if pursue only theoretical information, he has to put forward a plan to get worked up about his knowledge and something he is going to do equally. He has a head for figures which can make his personality, nut it depends on his sight of view in university, he can have a noticeable effect on his degree. In addition everyone has a mind of one's own whether get ready for a future job and lifestyle by learning lessons, different books and working out, or studying only for a piece of paper, called degree. But realize an ambition in different aspects of life or have an outstanding achievement in other profession.
	Finally it may far-fetched for some people to achieve their goals and expectations in university. But it won't be possible for a student to achieve his expectations unless he try as much as he can for making his goals accessible and study in advance levels of his favorite major.
In conclusion, we can say that it's the matter of students thought about every aspects of university degree. Whether they think it is valuable or not, they can gain more profession in what they are interested in or not, and if they attempt an effort help them to achieve their goals or not. Hopefully, I think university degree is not theoretical and prepares students for the real world. Naturally there are lots of differences between educated person's lifestyle and non-educated one. In university we would learn something beyond what we have learned before in other steps of our life.
