Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

There is a logical relationship between crime and punishment. In fact every action has its own results and the responsibility of the result of every action is on the one who does it. So s/he must face the music. In the society when one does things which are against the law, one must accept its consequences. In my opinion, living in civilized societies without a system for punishment is not a good idea. A society is called civilized not for the mere of reason of the personality of the people who live in them but for the sake of the modern systematic organizations which form the society such as governmental organizations and prison.
But what is considerable is that rehabilitation for those who are not obedient to the law can be very useful to take them away from the wrong way in their life and it may be more efficacious than the punishment itself. Rehab centers work directly on the mental problems which causes the anxiety in the criminals to take up the wrong doing. Hence if we work on the mental sanity of these criminals we might get good results.
Honoring criminal's personality is one of the ways which is very important in rehabilitation. Personality is one of the undeniable qualifications for all humanity. Different elements influence personality such as family. Family is the very first society that we experience and set foot in and also other organizations that we are a member of. In other words, we ourselves create our personality based on our life's values. Criminals are those who trample some parts of their lives' values but they cannot forget them. By honoring criminals' personality, we can help them to return to their values. We can help them find their real selves instead of injuring their very own characteristics traits.
In every one's personality, we can find both positive and negative points. I believe that by focusing on the negative points, we will just put them in such a way to stick in their minds the points and we stand in their light and perhaps we will never let them change, while we can put our finger on their abilities and talents to prove them how well they can start their life again. If we punish them in the severest way which is to hurt their feelings and pride, then it is like that we have done the same to them. We might be considered as criminals too and have no difference with them.
Trying to win some one's heart, whom we call a criminal, affection is another way which is related to rehabilitation as the new method. A gracious speech will be very useful in influencing some one and may prepare the way for speaker as for example councilor to be the most influential person in listener's life. Making up for an effective speech is another way. The speech should be effective in a way that produces some resolution to their problems. In other words, we have to find answers to their problems, let them know of the ways they could get out of their misery. Help them get up and start a new life. Speeches which only advise people of what to do and what not are just as good as bed time stories which one would get no benefit out of.
All in all I say that both punishment & rehabilitation is good and can be effective only if we know how to do it. There is always a way to every problem but we have to look round and find something which best suits our problem.
