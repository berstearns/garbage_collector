Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

Old people are always saying things about crimes and criminals, also those who are in power or in charge of it. We have all heard of different sort of reasons or solutions but actually it is hard to cope with it practically .
Personally I think prisons or detentions should have been with more supervision, especially when we may have different jailers or prisoners whom are mostly committed crime accidently even if they are really a vandal, smuggler, shoplifter, pickpocket, mugger or murderer. They have to be jailed separately due to the kind of their crimes. In this way some of experienced and hard-headed jailers can not have a team with a ringleader against them .
As everybody knows we do not want them to be punished illegually. In my opinion situation of the prison should make prisoners sure or worried about their lives after finishing their penalty. There might be something beneficial like giving score or sth which shows the way of their behaving. So jailers should be recognized by people in official positions that they could be considered as a promising person or no hoper person in their future .
There for, for instance some promising one can be transferred to a correction center and they can have a better situation now and future as well. Totally the motivation should not be taken from prisoners in order to reforme. Unlike should give them the opportunity or chance to turn to a healthy life for those who have prison sentence even life imprisonment because without that, jailers have no family and no one they can turn to, released from prison with nowhere to go .
I wish we did not have death penalty or death sentence. I am strongly against the capital punishment but as we all know unfortunately we have money-laundering and kidnappers that purposefully do wrong. In this case we have to take security measures and also more important thing is to take preventing measures .
TV violence is one of our significant reasons of criminals. The violence criminal has become a kind of hero figure in our time. He is glorified on the screen; he is pursued by the press and paid vast sums of money for his memoirs unfortunately, it is always fashionable type of movie. How ever many experts feel that violent TV programs make children more aggressive and they will grow up to be aggressive adults. To my mind, we mustn't refer to such a people as thugs, but as social misfits .
Believe it or not, charlatans are coming from the part of society that welfare or in a way that identify themselves like a right person. So they are kind of invisible criminals that are usually successful in their fraud. It is one of the most drastic problems and I do not know how to end up with. May be we should use of detector more before .
From my point of view, impostors or impostures are threats to a healthy society, and government should deal with it and cleanse our society from such these things. More important is, the government should not let invisible criminals off, or get away with or maybe up to now they are not thought criminals in some of estate agency or other jobs .
To sum up, taking measures like job training may help some people to get new skills and find work for not doing petty crime. I believe officials should encourage the prisoners with giving privilege which is related to the way of spending their sentences, because after releasing they need to this kind of supporter even for being a casual laborer also providing an surrounding in prisons in order to improve their knowledge or education can charge totally, as I know someone that he became a lawyer with studying in cell during or over his prison sentence .
The way of bringing up the children is the most important point in preventing crimes and being a good backer for our children help them avoid from crimes .
In fact care free families make them to no good. I think after having a suitable family we need healthy and safe society which is really necessary. For example replacing useful entertainment can be effective. Doing sports is one of the other things to prevent crimes. Having suitable sample that people can follow them as a model or good things can be helpful to prevent crimes .
