Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

What will happen for a prisoner? Have you ever thought about them? Have you ever seen a prison? You may have seen it in a movie but you cannot imagine how hard it is to live in. Obviously, prisons have many problems. Most of prisons are overcrowded; therefore, two prisoners have to share a one-man cell. The cells are cold and dirty, with little natural light and poorly screened toilets. Drugs are easily available. Violence is unavoidable and insecurity is obvious. The food is horrible. There ought to be difference between a dangerous criminal and a stealer. The future life of a prisoner is unclear and unfortunately not so good. The problem originates from four major reasons. First, there is not a comprehensive and useful instruction for how to control a prison. Second, there is not a serious supervision by independent inspectors and human rights activists. The third one is about the officials who see these problems and ignore them, and the last one is the existence of illegal prisons which results in illegal actions too.
Thousands of prisoners are released every year without anywhere to live, worsening problems of homelessness. Almost three-quarters of those in prison have mental health problems and almost two-thirds have drug problems. Prisons must combine elements of punishment with elements of rehabilitation. Not only should they work on reforming the character of prisoners but also to focus on preventing reoffending. Prisons should use techniques, like educational and vocational training to help the offender learn a skill for use outside the prison. Drug-addicted prisoners should also receive treatment for their condition in prisons. A large percentage of inmates are illiterate, and learning improvement will enable them to make a living. When an inmate is released from prison and returns to his previous environment, he often falls back into old patterns with former associates and ends up back in prison. He should learn how to cope with negative influences. It will help him to learn the social and antisocial characteristics of his friends, family and associates and makes him much less susceptible to harmful influences. An inmate should learn communication skills. These skills will increase his ability to face life and not withdraw from it. Every criminal has also a lack of self-respect. When a person can no longer trust himself, he becomes a threat to society and his fellow man. By restoring his sense of self-worth he can become a productive member of society. The study of all aspects of an individual's life and his personal ethics and integrity helps an inmate take responsibility for past misdeeds, rather than perpetuate them. Helping people to turn their backs on a life of crime is a slow and uncertain process, but it worth trying. Maybe you think that improved conditions and opportunities for rehabilitative activity in prisons generate the complaints that modern life behind bars is soft and too much like a holiday camp; however, these techniques and trainings build a safer and more secure world .
