Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

In my opinion, putting a person in prison is like putting him in a place with many aggressors, thug and insane altogether and expects him to come out sound and think established is not logical. But the question is that How can the prison be able to teach prisoners that justice, morality and soundness have value, while it will push criminals more into disappointment and dehumanize them and allow them to learn more tactics and reasons on how and why be violent by exposing them to other more-experienced criminals. Prison by itself can cause crime or may increase some criminal behavior. Depriving individuals from society is the most important problem with prison. Prison should not divest aggressors; we have to deal with them. Locking people up permits problems to rise and allow individuals' improbity to spread and affect others' behavior. Being excluded from society, may lead prisoners to feel they are being wronged, instead of having done wrong. They also may feel that their human rights are being denied .
Some specialists believed that the prison system is outdated and is in crucial need for change. Rates of imprisonment are unacceptable and some see it as a failed experiment. But governments believe that to have a safer society imprisonment should be more. They spend a lot on the imprisonment each year; while with removing imprisonment money would be free and can be put into the society where the problems really lie. Instead of spending a significant amount of money on locking people up, we can ask for better results by lowering use of imprisonment or even better alternatives. For example people with mental illness, needs to have access to better community-based treatment convinience for them rather than simply locking them up. For real cure of mental illness and drug and alcohol addiction investment should gush to decrease both prison and imprisonment rates. To deal effectively with the problems and their causes we need to look at other ways of tackling the problem. Prison cannot effectively deal with the individual and social problems that lead people to crime and felony. The prison system has a direct influence on people and the society. As some believe imprisonment have little impact on crime but a great cost to taxpayers and society and so calling for a major justice-system overhaul. It absorbs community money and creates festering sores of social futility. They suggest shorter sentences and parole terms, alternative punishments, more help for released inmates and decriminalizing recreational drugs. They believe these steps would cut the prison population in half, save budget and ease social inequality without endangering the public .
It can be spent making sure kids have got something beneficial to do. I think it would be better to concentrate more on prevention, on nurture, which would solve many problems that societies are facing. Researches showed that the influence of hunger, thirst, lack of nutrients and hopelessness on human mind in harmony with poverty, war, and even the effects of climate change can foster the rate of crime. Attempt to survive is an inherent human flair. If setting above your limits you will do whatever you can to survive. Now, I'm not going to say all prisoners don't deserve to be there, but I think prisons are epiphany of the society's fault. It is like a map which shows how we should act from very young ages. We have to focus on how we can bring our children up with love and support during their life span. All criminals were once children. It is not logical to think they had a dream at their childhood of being sociopathic killers or child rapists. Mental health problems are far widespread with no adequate treatment. If you behave like an animal with someone, he will treat like one. Prevention is an important key to all of this. Prison is just a Band-Aid .
