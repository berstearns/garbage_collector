Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

When the first prisons established, government considered them as the most important and effective punishment, but little by little, it lost its punitive effect . 
While governments imprisoned criminals, they had two purposes. First, to correct guilty persons, and second, they wanted other people be safe; because some criminals cannot be corrected, and the least they can do is to imprison them. On the other hand, on body can proudly say that he have had spent his time in prison, so it can be useful way to make people afraid of commit crimes. At the time a guilty person comes to prison because of the minor things he had done, he would become familiar with professional criminals and for sure it would affect his attempts. Consequently, government must separate them and do cultural efforts, but the purpose of governments must not show their power, because when somebody sentence to prison he lose his respect; consequently he does not commit crime any more. Then it is better that they pay money for their crimes, but; unfortuently, paying money instead of going to prison, make rich people think they can do whatever they want and whenever they have money, nobody can stop them and even, they consider this type of punishment as show off. But this certain punishment cannot be exactly measured and be fixe because the crimes and things that people commit are not like each other and there is no device to illustrate how much money must be spent as punishment, but in this cases, government and judicial branch can somehow define that almost how much the criminal should pay in order to get rid of being in prison . 
Thus, government ratify a new law that instead of criminals go to prison with his agreement do another things, such as work for government free .
There are some specific gadgets which can be placed in the body of criminals that can illustrate the place of that specific criminal, so that he cannot simply go or do whatever he wants and under this certain supervision, government can control them and dictate them what exactly do . 
In foreign country, they have specific law, it is NAME AND SHAME. In this law guilty person have plate that make clear his identity, in this plate all of his characteristics is written, such as his name, family, and what crime he had committed. He must be located at the place he had committed that crime and must state his remorse .
In England, there are more than 4.2 million cameras; it means for 14 people we have one camera and everybody more than 3000 times come across the camera; with these cameras, government try to control people, but has some disadvantages. First, for controlling people, governments need more lights and lamps in the street and it is very expensive. Second, governments need more people involved seeing through cameras and it is expensive too, but people do not agree with this law and they say that they have right to commit crimes, so government have right to arrest and punish them; they also claim that they do not want to be controlled .
I suppose immure criminals is not really a useful way to correct or punish people; on the other hand, it is a far better way to prevent people from committing crimes, but sometimes the condition of the country force people commit crime and it happens more in developing countries .
