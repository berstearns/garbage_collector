Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

Imprisoning criminals is a regular feature that happens all around the world. Some people are great believers in the idea that the prison system is outdated and that the criminals would rather be rehabilitated in any possible ways. Another group of people, however, take the side of prison as a very suitable punishment for which nothing better could be a replacement.
	As a dissident, I do agree with the idea that the basis or foundation of education inside the families and then in the society, no matter where in the world, is affection, and not punishment. I sometimes wonder we have a crisis on our hands with the rapid growth of the jails here and there, for it sure is a wakeup call and an alarming sign, warning us that the acts of crime have noticeably increased; therefore something must be done for that.
	According to statistics, putting criminals in jails not only doesn't decrease the number of crimes, but also might add to them in many cases. So what value is it to imprison people when in due time they're sent out like battle-weary troops, going on for a lowly way of living after freedom in such a deteriorating condition? Now if prison has made better people out of them, don't they really deserve a better life? Observations indicate that many cases keep living the very miserable life they used to have before going to jail, if not the worse. Rock - certainly, all attempts of those people in charge to make positive changes in prisoners and change them for good are just aborted, because no naughty kid will be manageable by being taunt that they're evil.
	I for one, reckon a resolution should be passed, as a result of which nobody would be sent to prisons, instead, to institutions in which the main reason(s)- many of which spring from childhood, based on psychology - causing the act of crime would aptly be known, and then eradicated, root and branch by professional experts. Although with a great deal of difficulty, it's worth leading them to live an ordinary life and put them back in good condition. Then later they could adopt new activities, according to their personal interests, including different hobbies like learning a musical instrument, books and movies worthy of reading and watching, doing exercises in various fields of sports, gardening, painting and whatnot.
	To my point of view, this is an edge and a big aid to them, because during this useful process, many of them will probably find a special skill gifted within them, of which they were totally unaware. This could also be a contribution to them for choosing the best occupation in which they're most immersed.
	To put it in a nutshell, in my opinion, to get the hold of their hands a new decision shall be adopted so as to fixate attention at the idea of trying out the plan on building schools instead of prisons, and if things won't go the way we want, we could just send the criminals back to jails!
