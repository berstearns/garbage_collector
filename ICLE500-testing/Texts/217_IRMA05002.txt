Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

There is no any doubt about it that, prison is a dangerous place, especially for those who enter it as the first time, have no concept of respect, and those who have been locked up the longest automatically receive deference for the time they have served. But the greatest danger is about officers working there: prison guards, who have pleasure with playing games with prisoners' lives. And, the staffs' violence, generally does not report also the reason for the attack, which is usually a form of prison flow.
Some people believed that private prisons are the answer for better conditions. But will private prison mean that more people will be put in jail for a longer time, to increase the owners profit (since the owner gets paid a set fee per prisoner per day). Will the private prison owners cut back on the prisoners benefits to save money? Do they prepare better conditions for the prisoners such as: better quality of food for the prisoners, gym, swimming pool, prisoners libraries, prisoner televisions entertainers who come to entertain the prisoners, prisoners computers for entertainment, rehabilitation program, medical care to the prisoners, or for saving more money they have already lower salaries for prison employees so the prisoners will get lower quality service by low level prison employees who have to accept low wages due to as they name: their low level skills? 

Or will the private Prisons somehow be good for whatever reasons! But the fact is that although government tried to give responsibility to private section but the situation of prisons are still Very bad, because profit becomes the first priority instead of rehabilitation. Here is a fact: a prison is a prison. That's all. Prisons are not meant to be good places to be. They are not resort communities where people lie around and have to work unwillingly. There are no psychoanalysis treatments.

There are gangs and violence all around the prisons, and while these are prevalent, it is not as necessary as some might have you believe to become involved with them. Prisoners often try to join to one of groups to survive. Groups which are gather under a name of a person who usually is done the worst crucial and savage action and the group have a name chosen by him. There is no Greeting Group led by anyone named waiting ready to support poor and weak prison members. Nothing is faire in a prison . 

There is an important question here: What is the responsibility of a prison? To establish justice? But how? Is it possible to settle justice In an injustice environment?
