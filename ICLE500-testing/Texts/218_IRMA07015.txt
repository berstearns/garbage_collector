Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

The just way of punishing criminals has been a question which has met much controversy over the years. The ideal system of justice has undergone many changes during the decades; yet, sociologists and psychologists are unsuccessful in finding the ultimate answer . 
Many consider the current prison system to be the best solution; secluding the black sheep from the rest of the herd seems to be the easiest way after all. The criminal is to spend his time in prison and learn to adhere to the society's disciplines. That seems a fair enough treatment, but unfortunately there are some downsides to it .
The first of its disadvantages seems to be that in many cases, a criminal is not refined at all after his time in prison. He might even be aggravated by being punished so. The reason seems to be that imprisoning doesn't provide any special way of honing the felons, they are simply kept from harming other members of the society by force. Also, as they stay in their cells, angry and embittered, they inevitably socialize with their inmates, many of whom are possibly callous. Therefore, a young and rather innocent human being who had committed a somewhat minor mistake would morph into a ruthless villain. The tax paid by honorable citizens would be spent pampering people who cherish the idea of taking revenge on those same humans. That barely seems fair .
But imprisoning also has its own benefits. For instance, one is forced to face the outcome of his actions and also, in case of those who have committed unpardonable crimes, the life sentence would keep them from further harming innocent society members .
The alternate system of disciplining the delinquent is rehabilitating them. Some consider this method as being too mild and tolerant toward the offenders, but this doesn't seem to be the case. The culprit is sent to a rehabilitation center and he has to stay there for a specified time so as to be prepared for living in the society without breaking its laws. During that time, he has the opportunity to benefit from the service of professional psychologists who will help him adapt himself to rules and regulations. After his stay in the rehab center, the wrongdoer would return to the society without any feelings of resentment and with a strong desire for success and perfection .
The benefits of this particular method seem to be numerous; the offender is actually refined and elevated to some useful human being, he would not suffer from the general backlash against convicts, and is presented with clear-cut morals to help him as he faces further dilemmas later in life .
In spite of their advantages, rehabs also have their drawbacks. The expenses being high and the possibility of some reservedness on the part of criminals, are two of the doubts many share about this approach to refining offenders .
None of the systems above seem to be perfect and applicable to all societies. The underlying reason might be that each community has its own unique culture, and treating all of them with the same rules is more than simply illogical . 
Some societies, especially those who have not yet undergone drastic changes, are very strict and severe toward those who break their carefully-set laws; any redundant care or help bestowed on the villains would be considered as an encouragement of the future lawbreakings. Therefore, in a community such as the ones sketched in the previous lines, the prison system is the best approach since it is not at variance with the deep-rooted culture of its members .
On the other hand, in a more dynamic society, the rehab system seems to be the ideal solution. In such a community, people would not consider this method as being docile; because they are well aware that civilization demands the abolishment of vile systems and traditions . 
A certain system has to be chosen and adopted with great care and consideration; after all, if not compatible with the culture and beliefs of the people, it would cause many difficulties. The necessary changes in a culture need to be made gradually, allowing people enough time to adjust themselves, so that in reasonable time, adopting a wholly different system of disciplining lawbreakers would become possible
