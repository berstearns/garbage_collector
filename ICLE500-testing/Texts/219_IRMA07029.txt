Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 
	
	First, I want to define some definitions that are necessary to know First, criminal according to Oxford Advanced English Dictionary Criminal offence is an act that is harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community. Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law if a person happens to do a criminal offence he would become a prisoner. Based on Merriam Webster Dictionary a prisoner, also known as an inmate, is a person who is deprived of liberty against their will; this is the second. Now about the topic of this essay we should know that; many individuals believe that rehabilitation is one of the major purposes of the prison, but why should the rehabilitation happen in prison and not in other communities? It is widely believed that the prison system is outdated and no civilized society should punish its criminals, it should rehabilitate them. We should know that some criminals choose the prison as a place for learning crimes rather than for avoiding crimes, and after they became free they continue their crimes .

	Lack of legal educational programs, teaching job skills would result in uneducated individuals who are more interested in taking the risk of doing crime. And also some of them, are who try to follow their leads. Leaders in prison are mostly those who are more intelligent than others, and sometimes their punishment is lifelong prisoner. These people have great influence on others, and they should not encourage them to do so . 
	They should define rehabilitation as a way to help somebody to return to a normal life by providing therapy which would prevent prisoner from having a desire to go back to prisons but actually they do not do this. They encourage and teach them new criminal . 
	Actually the leader of the prison or someone who is responsible for the prison must doing something for them. Government and public could run some communities to teach these prisoners rather than to punish them, and I heard that they established some workshops and they taught them some works like: wood carving, painting and something like this, but some criminals did not work, and I totally agree with this idea because when they come back from prison they can work for themselves and make a new life for them selves and their family. another thing about their families is that when they are in jail their families have not a good life with out them .
The bad reality about them is that their families left them a lone .
	Another important thing in my idea is about some prisoners who are debtor; I think that they should have another place. they should not be in a place that dangerous criminal are there. They should have a special place because I think they do not do crime, and I think government is responsible for this, and they should rehabilitate this rule and provide a special location for them .
	The other thing is about the youngsters who are in prison I think the rules that refer to them must rehabilitate. Because some of them are actually innocent. Some of them became assassin because of doing a foolish work in a moment they lose their control and they kill some body. That is not true they wait till they become eighteen to gallows, when they are in prison in this time they do not have any hope for their future lives or about others who are in prison for stealing. I think they are whom that have problems in their lives and with their families. Most of them have not parent, And have not a good family to support them, and they grow in ruin places with criminals that they teach them stealing from people and begging in streets or selling some goods .

	I think government should do something for this problem they can provide a suitable place for this child that they can have a real life with a suitable place for sleep, for education and they plane for their future time that is their right like other children .
	I believe the laws about this children should rehabilitate, and about the votes commanded by a arbiters need some changes .
I heard that in one city in our country a judge commanded a interesting vote about two boys that killed a rare animal in forest, this judge said to this boys that they should write an essay about animals and environment instead of going to prison .
	I think judicature should spread this new laws, and ideas in our country and rehabilitate them till there is no innocent prisoner in prison .
