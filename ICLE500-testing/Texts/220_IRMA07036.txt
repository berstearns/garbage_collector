Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

	Everybody has the right to live in a safe society. Sometimes, this safety is under the threat by those who break the law. These criminals are responsible, so they must meet the consequences of their actions and this happens by putting them in jail. Some people believe that by punishing inmates, we can prevent them from committing more crimes, while others believe that we have to put all efforts to reform them. In fact, we should make a balance between controlling and reforming them.
	Many people think that the first and foremost justification for prisons is mere punishment. I believe they say so because punishment can be the easier solution in hand, this can be also because we have the habit of punishing even in our daily life. If a child misbehaves, her mom or caretaker punishes her for her wrong deed. Instead of thinking in depth and finding the reason behind her action they threat the child to punish her, and the degree of punishment varies according to her action. For sure, punishment can reduce wrong deeds, but for sometimes. In this case, the child will find the courage, because she has tasted the punishment and she is not scared anymore. Punishment alone may not be enough. Not all behaviors are changeable through punishment. So, the point here is that if we punish criminals, our community can be protected in a short run, but how about the long run?
	Some other people believe that prisons should be a place to rehabilitate. Rehabilitation means providing therapy and education classes for prisoners in hope that they experience a normal life in future. This is great, but not everyone wishes to be rehabilitated. It all depends on the individual's decision, whether he wants to change or not. Since we are not aware of their motives for doing the crime, rehabilitation can get even harder. Based on all these things, if the criminal justice system spends huge amounts of money and time and energy on prisoners, that would be a waste.
	In fact, I do believe that punishment and rehabilitation should be seen as complementary. Our purpose for imprisoning inmates must be punishing them in the first place, but more importantly, making sure that this is helping them to behave like a normal person in their society. By punishing, I do not mean treating them inhumanly. In fact, criminals should be treated in a way that we expect them to treat when they are released in future. They should receive care and respect, so that they will be able to give them to others. If we segregate them from society to punish them, they will explode and commit more crimes when they come out of jail. To me, reform does not mean taking it easy on prisoners. They should not receive leniency; instead, they must do long hours of hard work with no payment. There must be tough rules and desciplines. Inmates must be aware that everything has a pay off. At the same time, there must be therapy classes to provide an opportunity to change the way they think and act and stop them from committing further crimes. Therefore, based on what stated, combining punishment and rehabilitation can be the most effective strategy that the criminal justice system can use.
