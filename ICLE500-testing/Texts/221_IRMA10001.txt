Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

	As the science gains momentum, so do the applicants for universities. Call it keeping up with the Joneses or a deep-rooted passion for learning for the sake of it, the number of graduated students at various levels of education in different fields is skyrocketing. Each semester, loads of alumni with their degrees are injected to the vessel of job seeking and working systems, but the question is: Can they get the most of their acquired knowledge or they are holding merely a certificate and they are literally some chassis stuffed with absurd theories, ineffective regarding to real world? Well, the question has its own proponents and opponents. Here come some of their claims:
	On one hand, advocates may say that university is a place that offers a spectrum of miscellaneous subjects. If you are smart enough, you will be able to make them work for you, even if they are just sheer theories and nothing more. Furthermore, they might say that science is based on theories, then the theory is a prerequisite to almost any kind of job, as a result, by knowing a set of theories regarding to a specific issue, you can check on different aspects and dimensions, subsequently you will be able to come up with better solutions and make up for the probable upcoming shortfalls and that is what segregates the grassroots from the elites . (In a sense that you consider a university - graduated person an elite!). So for them, universities are no vocational training place and if someone wants to get hold of such functional skills, s/he can register at a university which provides such abilities such as: University of Applied Science and Technology.
	Turning to the other side of the argument, the martinet opponents claim that the society is in desperate need of dexterous labor force, not heads inflated with theories. The moderate ones may say that theories are necessary but not sufficient. They go further that there should be a link between these written formats, their corresponding usage and the real, tangible issue, but unfortunately, in many cases, this ring is lost. They claim that instead of theories, the element of logic behind the theory and the problem should be taught, otherwise, getting hands on concrete, useless forms written in books, articles, journals, etc. can be achieved without the assistance of professors, i.e. it is not of complex nature and almost any normal, literate person with an average-to-above IQ can understand and grasp the material more or less. Then we can conclude that for them, mere theory holders have no place in a working society.
	I myself am likely to go for the second group, but at the same time, I cannot deny the very fact of this simple but oh-so-true sentence: Education is never worthless, even if it is too sheer a theory, it can come handy, at least it broadens and widens the peoples' attitudes, makes them look at the issue from another angle and also exercises their minds. To my way of thinking, we can have some solutions which a couple of them are listed below:
	We can say that if universities provide hands-on workshops alongside the material, this controversy can somehow be alleviated. One other probable solution is to run needs analysis for each occupation and design teaching materials in a suitable framework to establish the above-mentioned link.
	There still remains another problem, which is the supply and demand issue. The question is that do we really need as many graduated students in our working system - even if almost all of them are so assiduous a student - as currently we have? Or there should always be an unremitting competition for job vacancies?
