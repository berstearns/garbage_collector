Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

Nowadays it is thought that most university degrees do not guarantee whether students can measure up in a particular job or not! Unfortunately when it comes to reality and involving with practical aspects of the theories which are learned during the years of attendance at school and then at university level, many students are not capable enough. Admittedly, this problem exists; and the purpose of this essay is to come up with an explanation. But before going through reasons, we should bear in mind that at the same time there are students who have put their theoretical knowledge and information to use and don't limit themselves to memorization and they are not just obsessed about grades; so they have made best of their degrees. Therefore the first reason is devoted to students' attitude.

I remember when I was a school student, there were some sections in some of our course books called To Know More and those parts were not intended to appear on our exams, so most of the students didn't read them and just a few ones were interested to know more for its own sake. Sometimes the same story happens in universities. Many university students are not motivated enough to read more than is required or to discover something new. So they end up like people who hold university degrees but not really excel in their majors. So they may go to school and university and extending their higher education, but they do it, not because of genuine and personal interest but because of other reasons like parental pressure or show-off, etc. And they gain university degrees eventually but do you consider such degrees truly worthwhile? And how is it possible to dedicate ourselves to a job or everything in our lives if we do not like what we are doing?! After graduation and starting a job related to one's major, some students realize that it wasn't what they wanted. So recognizing and cultivating our talent is so significant . 
Another reason is the inefficient system of education in some of our schools and even universities. What's mostly valued is how well students memorize the material and receive a good score. I do not intend to mention that it is totally wrong but what about improving a more comprehensive and richer understanding of that subject? And it gets much worse when we are dealing with the courses that carrying out experiments is the integral part of them. In highschool, although I got good grades in physics, most of the time I didn't fully grasp the theories because the experiments weren't usually conducted practically. This issue reminds me of the Chinese proverb that goes [Quotation] In this case universities are better but still they can take more steps about it. In order to satisfy this requirement, more facilities and opportunities for doing practical trainings and workshops in addition to theoretical aspects should be provided for students. And about universities, one crucial issue is that we should establish a close link between industries or working environment and educational environment; and the number of students attending universities should be determined by job opportunities and needs of society . 

Finally I would like to mention how teachers and instructors can have an influential and positive role in this process. Now as an English language student at university level, I can't forget my experience in one of my courses _Pedagogic Phonology _ when we were asked to write an essay based on what we learned during that course; so we as students learned how to move from mere knowledge to the level of application and analysis in order to solve a problem. I found it so interesting and useful and I believe it is something that makes learning more memorable and effective and students can see how the material and theories they've learned can work more realistically and the reason was that we were deeply engaged with the material. So the role of informed and creative instructors and teachers in making learning more effective and life-long is indisputable . 
As a conclusion, learning theories should go hand in hand with learning how to put them in use for solving problems and making significant discoveries. And I believe it is not just the matter of education or work, it is a matter of life, too. As this proverb nicely put this issue in a nutshell that [Quotation] .
