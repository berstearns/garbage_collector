Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

Nowadays, in our country, the rush for entering universities does not let us to even think whether what we learn there is practical in our future career, or not. It seems that our learning at university is so theoretical that cannot be used in real life career. Actually, universities have forgotten their ultimate goal which is preparing students for the occupation related to their majors. Students pass different theoretical courses and few or none practical ones. Even if they pass a practical course, it is not taught in a way that can provide them with experience or make them become familiar with their future possible career. Moreover, as they cannot link their educational background to career related to it, they choose careers which are completely unrelated to their degree. Therefore, curriculum design, masters and students are three evident factors that show students just learn about theories and read about practice at university, which is not enough .
Curriculum design is a leading factor in orienting toward theory or practice. If we have a theoretical orientation, we can add more theoretical courses to the curriculum, and if we have a practical orientation, more practical courses and workshops can be added. However, by taking a look at the curriculum for different majors (whether related to human, basic or engineering science), it would be noticed that most courses are theoretical. The courses are about the history of the major and the theories, and students may read about their application. These students rarely ever have the opportunity to utilize and experience the theories as they learn them. Consequently, educational system at universities does not provide a situation that students can be able to establish a relation between theories and their practice; the gap which even masters find hard to fill . 
We all have had masters whose knowledge we wondered about. But it has rarely happened that we wonder how experienced our master is in related careers to our major. Most masters, all their lives, have been studying hard to pave their ways to get PHD, and finally become what they are now. Consequently, they hardly ever had the opportunity to work, and scarcely faced what the related careers require. When they become a university master, they try to teach what they are expert at, not things they know a little about. Therefore, they focus on theories. It worth mentioning that, here, curriculum design may also lead experienced masters to teaching theoretically . 
As a result of the above mentioned factors, students cannot establish a connection between theories and their usage in related careers. This may lead some of them to choose a job completely unrelated to their educational background . 
In conclusion, our curriculum design for majors, the masters and the students, as mentioned above, completely support the idea that universities focus more on theoretical issues rather than practical ones. These three have also changed our attitude toward going to university. We think going to university and graduating means reading some books, taking some exams, then passing the courses and finally getting a degree. However, we are so confused that we never ask, To get a job, do I need to go to university?
