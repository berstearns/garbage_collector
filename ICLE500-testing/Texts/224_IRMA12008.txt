Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

	Since the advent of neural synapse in human brain people were concerned how to turn ideas into action. You should keep in mind that the question provided can be subjectively addressed by anyone who comes across with it. Here I'll briefly mention two thick walls that separate us from the spectrum of knowledge and practice. To begin with, the lack of the right method of learning within universities. Secondly, the absence of sheer will force in each and every individual within the period of education. With these contextual and intrapersonal factors, the graduates can rarely relate university learning to real life problems therefore I think the university degrees are becoming more theoretical nationally . 

	Throughout the world or at least in the developed countries the current established method of learning is PBL(Problem Based Learning), unfortunately we are still living in the stone era of implementing the modern approaches and methods of education in the curriculum design. The method Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject just like real life through the experience of problem solving. Students learn both thinking strategies and domain knowledge. The goals of PBL are to help the students develop flexible knowledge, effective problem solving skills, self-directed learning, effective collaboration skills and intrinsic motivation that are critically important in encountering real life situations. The tutor builds students' confidence to take on the problem, and encourages the students, while also stretching their understanding. PBL represents a paradigm shift from traditional teaching and learning philosophy, which is more often lecture-based, theoretically passed, contains way more theoretical units than practical ones and it is used in the whole nation as the primary method of teaching. PBL educates students in a way that they would behave efficiently not only in a domain specific task but also in real life problem solving ones. Our system of education lacks such a perfectly designed method of teaching and learning. So the students cannot benefit from real life stimulations and as a result the problem of relating university learning to real life situations arises.


	Preparation for real life starts since birth. From childhood the humans interacts with the real world through trial and error, reasoning and prior experience of others. Consequently each human being perceives the surrounding world differently from one another; some choose to gain experience from a mistake and look at it positively, meanwhile others try to ignore the whole happening and bury it deep down among other unpleasant errors of human kind. Like all the changes in human condition success comes from will; with the brute force of perseverance the individual can outwit the real life challenge eventually. Since this four legged creature is capable of thinking and making decisions from childhood, in the end the choice is up to the person whether to develop a will toward succession or to be doomed to failure. Observational studies have shown that people think life is becoming harder to get by each year. The reasons and motives for such negative attitude could be economical, regional, psychological, physiological, political, cultural and personal. Thus not having the required volition causes increased rates of difficulty in encountering real life situations . 


The failure in preparation of students for real life can be caused by two reasons. First, problem of do not having the right implemented approach to learning, teaching and assessment that could best serve the growing number of applicants in different fields of study in order to relate theory to practice in real life. Second, we have the power of will; you and I know that it would have the strength to melt mountains to the surface if it is used in a way to see problems solvable and goals reachable. Accordingly the reasons for such depravation may arise from the surrounding of a person or from within him/herself.
