Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

Today getting an academic degree has become so important that almost none of the students pay attention to what they are going to study during that course and whether the units are theoretical or practical. If what is taught in the universities mostly consists of theoretical matters then the student will not be well prepared for the job market in the real life, some experts say. In this essay I try to state a few reasons both for and against the above claim. Some of these reasons are as follows: learning only theories without any practice is like learning how to swim without even getting wet. The job market is and always will be going to need some experts who not only know how to do something but are also capable of doing it. There are always some points where we cannot afford the consequences of a blind risk and here is where using theory we can lower the risk .

Although knowing theories is helpful, as long as a person is not able to use them in real life, they are doomed to fail. Statistics show that more than sixty percent of university graduates have been left unemployed due to lack of experience and practical skills. As a matter of fact companies and factories are tending to employ those who already know for example how to work with a machine or to fix a computerized system. So at this point I think it is the universities job to teach students how to put what they have learnt into practice .

The biggest concern of almost every university student in Iran is unemployment after graduating. This concern leads the poor youths to pursue higher education, not knowing that there is nothing waiting for them but more and more theoretical matters. Saeed Bagheri, a twenty-three year old electronic engineer who graduated from university of Shiraz last year, says that: [Quotation] , said Saeed. But looking at the glass half full, theories are not useless at all . 

Practice without theory is blind. It means that it is not worth taking any risk without knowing what the prices are. Just think of a skyscraper that needs to be torn down, of course no healthy mind in the entire world would take the responsibility of pushing the explosion button without knowing what exactly will be happening next. See! So it is not fair to say that practice always have superiority over theory. Moreover, we should bear in mind that, a society would also need theorists who shed some lights on the way of practical experts, and without whom we never could afford the prices of our wrong choices .

To sum up this essay I should say, I agree that universities should allocate much more time on training their students with practical skills rather than spending almost all their time teaching theoretical matters. In the same time I also should mention that I strongly disagree with those who underestimate the value of theoretical issues. In my opinion a university student should have a good command on both theoretical and practical matters for that as Marx says: [Quotation] .
