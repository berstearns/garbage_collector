Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 
 
These days, education plays an important role in each society. Everybody attempts to be educated. They enter university to improve their knowledge on a specific subject in order to be an expert and this issue is more important for young members of society. However, there are some debates on the purpose of education. Mostly believe that the purpose of education is preparing the students for their future job, while some argue that most of the university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. In my opinion, obtaining a university degree does not necessarily mean that one is ready to start working. There are some reasons that I am going to discuss in the following paragraphs .
The first reason is that the statics show that most of the people who are graduated from university do not have a job that is related to the subject matter that they have studied at university. We can also see some people who have M.A or B.A in some field of study; however, they are working in a place that is totally different from the degrees they hold. For example, best scenario considered in Iran a person who wants to be an English teacher, before getting a B.A and studying in a university for that purpose, can be a good English teacher. Another example is that, there are a lot of great English teachers that they studied engineering in university or any other subject matters but have proved to be great teachers. Another one applies to the situation where holding a B.A or M.A, regardless of what the subject matter is, will give one the opportunity to be accepted in some important jobs like being a banker, or working in a governmental company. It means that the subject matters that are being taught in universities are not related to the job opportunities that exist in the society. Therefore, it shows the impracticality of the university degrees regarding the fact that they do not prepare students for real life situations .
The Second reason is that the theoretical credits that students have in university are a way more than the practical credits that they have. In most of the prestigious Iranian universities, most of the credits are theoretical, and when it comes to the practical credits there are always some problems like not having enough equipment, enough time and having over crowded classes that the professor decides to skip them and do not waste the time in order to work more on the theoretical credits. As result of this, there are some training courses that before having a job, one has to attend them. These training courses are totally educational without any payment and one has to enroll in order to get the job. For example, even if someone has a B.A in teaching English, that person has to pass some teacher training courses in order to start working in an institute. On the other hand, a person who has studied an irrelevant major to teaching English, only by passing these training courses is competent enough to teach in any institute. Some people argue that people who have passed those courses at university and then pass these training courses will be more knowledgeable and successful. However, the truth is that they will be more knowledgeable but not necessarily more successful in real life and their job. The point is that the credits that students pass during their education program at university are more theoretical than being practical and do not prepare students for the real life .
Consequently, as I mentioned above, most of the university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Universities need to focus in some areas to prepare the students for the real life. First, they should improve the classrooms to the latest technology and keep up with the new technology and innovations. Second, professors must be qualified and proficient in the subjects or skills they are about to teach. A professor who knows nothing about the subject matter cannot prepare students for the real life. Third, curriculum must keep up with newest and latest knowledge and it has to constantly change depending on what is relevant in the workplace. In other words, it must include all the knowledge, skills and training that is necessary for a person who wants to start working after graduation. And they should always consider that Students must be required to show mastery of the skills that they have studied before graduating. It is not enough that they graduate. They must be highly-skilled graduates. The ultimate goal must be for students to be prepared for a life beyond their classrooms .
