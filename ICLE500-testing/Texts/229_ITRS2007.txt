Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Generally speaking, nowdays the number of students who attend University has increased. I don't exactly know the situation in foreign countries, but in Italy some Universities are crowed with students, who sometimes decide to attend it just because they can't find a job after High School .
Obviously University is seen as a sort of passport for the working world, but we know that most degrees do not prepare students for it. Let me give you some examples .
I'm taking a degree in foreign languages and literatures and I'm still really proud of my chooice .
I study English and Spanish, besides many other subjects, and one day I'd like to teach them. But when I think about this possibility I get very sceptical because I don't feel able to teach Spanish at all .
I don't think I can speak Spanish fluently even if I passed the three exams with high marks .
Actually the classes were too theoretical and students didn't have enough time for Spanish conversation, not to mention the fact that most of the classes were in Italian. In short, I believe I have a good knowledge of Spanish literature but a modest one in language. What I'm trying to say is that, too often, University is not qualifying and students need to specialize in the subject they are going to deal with in the working world .
I have just talked about my personal case, but I know that many scientific degrees are even worse. For instance, Italian engineers are said to be among the best in the world. But is this true?
How can this be possible if they start going to the laboratory for experiments only after the fourth year?
I have a lot of friends who are studying engineering and most of them have very good marks in computer subjects, while actually don't even know how to use a computer! Are their exams of any value?
Let's now talk about the most theoretical degree at all: law. In Rome this department is the most crowed. Students have to get to University two hours before classes start if they want to find a seat and to listen to the teacher. Everything is learned in theory without any contact with courts .
Naturally there aren't only disadvantages in a theoretical degree. Actually students have often excellent cultural bases and this proves advantages when they decide to take a M.A. in another country. In this case they will become very good workers because they will acquired theoretical system and practical knowledge. But what about people who can't afford it, or who don't want to start studying again?
The problem persists and I believe it can only be solved with a general reorganization of University system .
It should be given more emphasis at the practical part because in the real world a person who can use a computer is by far more useful than one who has studied how to use it!
