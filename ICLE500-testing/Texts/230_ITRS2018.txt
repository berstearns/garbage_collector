Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The 20th century is also called * modern world *, because by now everything is dominated by science technology and industralisation. Computers, robots, internet and virtual reality have replaced man and his duties. Nowadays, communicate with someone who lives on the other side of the world is very easy, as well as, staying at home and ordering the computer to do the shopping.....that is not surprising .
Travelling all over the world is a simple thing and quick as a flesh, one can end up catapulted from Cape town to VANCOUVER in less than eight hours and I would not be surprised if two people spent a honeymoon on the moon or on MARS.
Manual work and heavy jobs have been replaced by science technology or rather by sophisticated robots which carry out its duties better than men or woman. Today, working in a factory or in a mine, present minor risks compared to the past; moreover, in the days, the figure of man with his head bowed under a pit or a press, is disappearing. Even if, in some part of the world, these * offices * are assigned to the poor children who cannot refuse to accept them, since they need them, and so they are exploited. In short, I would not define it as an homogeneous industralisation, or rather, I would call it partial (industralisation).
New towns, built-up areas and skyscrapers that skim (over) the sky, multiply themselves daily, while our greenery is decreasing more and more. The countryside is not a peaceful place any more where one can relax, or place where a poet can find his inspiration for writing a poem .
Wordsworth drew his inspiration from the Lake District scenery, today, this is not possible any more. Why? Because our countryside has been industrialised and it has become a continual succession of factories, plants and motorways that have taken the place of small farms, brooks and panoramic viewpoints. Even our coasts with its beautiful beaches, that once gave us romantic sunset, are now full of innovating hotels and holiday villages .
Nowadays, every place has become terribly touristy, and on the other hand, it has lost its own romanticism. This marks the beginning of a new era, where there is no longer a place for dreaming, imagination and creativity, an era exactly defined as the mechanical age. So we are awake of the risk and the loss that this space age implies!! Because as we know, creativity and originality are more important than technical skill .
It is not surprising, if in the near future, our children will play with real spaceships or will operate by remote control real passenger trains or will pilot fighter planes. I do not know where are the frontiers between science and reality. Probably, our playgrounds will be replaced by real motor racing tracks or real runways, while the classic merry-go-rounds sink into oblivion .
In my opinion, all that cannot be defined as * modern world *: firstly, because the industralisation is partial, as we have already seen; secondly, it is no use having children able to pilot a plane, if then, they are not able to write a love letter or to use their own imagination. All that is very sad!
