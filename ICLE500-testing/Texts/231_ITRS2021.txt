Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
After having finished schools many students go up to the university with the hope of being better prepared for their job to come; they sometimes choose a degree because, according to the statistics, it is better valued when you are looking for a work .
This is the reason of the recent boom of some university degrees which offer a more practical preparation for real world of work: if studying data-processing gives you a job, you will study them; if becoming an expert in economy gives you a good chance, you can't help taking it .
Those degrees which are more theoretical than practical are in a period of crisis; they are considered of very little value. I do not agree with it .
It is important to be prepared for the world of work but you can't choose a degree only to have a work, putting by all your inclinations .
What is wrong is the structure of Italian universities; it can't stand comparison with the development of technology and industrialisation. Politicians do nothing or very little to change this situation with new laws and funds .
Including some new exams in the prospectus of those degrees which are too theoretical could be a solution; you could have exams in which applying your theoretical knowledge to practical matters; you could have a general idea about topics without which you don't fit in the world of work .
They could be maths, law and economy because when you look for a job you are requested to know them .
When you know these topics, then you are free to choose your degree without being afraid about future possibilities of work and without giving away your dreams .
Men do not have the same inclinations and the same desires; what university must cope is the homologation to a standard even if statistics say that it wins. It is better to have ingeneers or architects who love their job instead of having potential philosophers who are compelled to become architects only to receive a salary .
You can't forget that some disciplines are purely theoretical but they are not less important because of it; if society asks more and more for a skilled and practical preparation what about the human knowledge which is not important in the production process? What about an obscure line of poetry or the history of ancient civilization? They have value, a great value to mankind even if there is no place for them in the real world of work .
