Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Church has always inebriated people's mind, first with cruel prophecies about the fire of hell, then with the promise of psychological order in an age of competition, exploitment and materialism as our age is .
Centuries ago, Church preached a terrible and vindictive God, who, on the day of the Judgment, would have punished those who had not behaved according to his laws. It disseminated great superstitions threatening people to the point that they really believed in witches and in the Inquisition's condemnations of women to stake. Church convinced people that hey are * sinners in the hands of an angry God *, so that religion must be present in every action of everyday life to avoid evil and sin. But Church hided the luxury of its ministers under a veil of puritanism and profiting from people's ignorance, they sold the indulgences to support their expensive way of living .
Nowadays Church preaches a merciful God, who can satisfy their request of graces in exchange of prayers. It continues to profit from people's sense of superstition, it is not so intolerant as in previous centuries, but it contributes to maintain a fatalistic mentality, according to which everything comes from heaven. It preaches about peace among people, against violence upon women, and about every sort of modern mental and physical abuse; but it never concretely participates to establish peace or stop violence. There are very few cases of clergymen who fight against * mafia * or against * drug *.
Church must awake people from the dream that * Divine Providence * brings welfare. On the other hand, it is true that people need to believe in a pre-established order, to take rest from the stress of making money. Church offers some values, some * opium * in which everyone can abandon himself and forget the psychological stress he is exposed to .
In the 20th century, people are distracted by something different from religion. It is not Church that bombards people's mind with false news, but it is television that confounds masses, presenting things from restricted points of view, so that people cannot see the whole reality of thing - just like Church did centuries ago to obtain the favour of the masses. Television is manipulated by political parties which show things as they would like them to appear. People let themselves at the mercy of the most various news, without detecting the real aim of those who want to manipulate public opinion presenting a distorted reality .
Television is also dangerous because we live in an age of extreme vulnerability. After the slogan * God is dead * some of the certainties of humanity are lost, so people are in search of other gods. Actors, top models, singers, managers of industry become the new idols to worship and to imitate .
Television contributes to present how easy is to reach a comfortable way of living .
Girls become anorex in order to look like Claudia Schiffer, some people dedicate to illecit affairs to gain money to have a beautiful * villa * like that of any manager of industry; even because they know from television journal that some gangsters of the underworld are not judged as they deserve. In fact they repent of what they have done, they collaborate with * justice * and so they are protected by that law that should condemn them for their crimes .
Television influences people beyond the limit of danger; it can be noticed a relationship between the unjustified death of a student and the previous telecast of a film in which one of the protagonist kills some people without any reason. Today, some people suffer from frustration or other psychological illness, so that they can be easily influenced .
On the other hand, television tries to sensitise the masses to the problem of violence, telecasting * Film dossier *, or debates, or it tries to * save * children from watching violent films by marking them with red marks of danger. However, all this is done to be marked as a good TV channel and so to raise the audience. In fact, there are few television personages engaged in the campaign against violence on children, or on women, while the most part are engaged to replace the * Divine Providence * with the * Television Providence *, as if everyday life is easy like soap opera's life, and as if the aims people propose in their life are easy to reach .
Even publicity presents a happy family, causing a sort of shock for those children who hear their parents quarrelling .
Real life is different. Apart those cases of drunk father and mother and drugged sons, who however exist, a normal family lives problems of money and little controversies between brothers and between sons and parents .
We must distinguish what real life is and the distorted reality television shows of modern age .
