Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Although it is not long since television has been invented, it has become the most used electrical household appliances all over the world .
At the beginning, in Italy, only well-to-do people could buy a television set due to the high price and the low economic level of most of the population. It was a rarity looked at with admiration! But thanks to the increased economic level during the fifties and the sixties, television was available to every family and it became the symbol of the gained welfare .
Nowadays people make an uncontrolled use of television, each family has one or two television sets at home; in some desperate cases there is even a television set in each room of the house. Television is no longer a symbol of the achieved prosperity but its presence in a house is obvious because it passed from a rarity to a common electrical household appliances or rather a mania .
At first was considered as means of information and entertainment and those people who did not have it, gathered in public places such as bars where there was one in order to watch it and exchange opinions. But now it is alienator because even in a family people are more concentrated in watching TV than talking to each other. During the few moments in which a family gathers together such as lunch, supper or in the evening the television set is on in 95% of the cases. Widespreading its use, the values transmitted by television have changed too .
If at the beginning a kind of censorship checked that a good language polished from vulgar words or concepts was used; that dancers and announcers were well dressed, today there is freedom of ideas and of representation. A freedom which is sometimes wrongly exploited by those who make television and in the name of money and business they transmit news, discussions, crime, sex, violence without control. It depends on the spectator to choose programmes of quality and to avoid the so-called * trash * television. But television has acquired a strong power on its spectators so that not all of them are capable of distinguishing good quality from bad quality. People tend to consider as true everything they watch on TV but it is not so .
Sometimes some news are false or not correctly reported and they are transmitted in order to increase audience but the passive spectators are those people who watch TV in a not objective way and let themselves be influenced by it .
For example advertising has a strong influence on people because many prefer buying a product even if it is the most expensive only because it is advertised on TV and consequently considered absolutely good. This television has become an instrument of commerce through advertising and it handles people's preferences .
How forget the interest of politicians for the television scene as a channel to express their ideas through obliging journalists who emphasize personal political ideas in their programmes instead of being neutral and objective .
The line between ethic and not ethic is subtle and it can be easily surmounted but this does not mean that television is totally negative .
One can not forget the positive aspects such as informing, instructing and entertaining which may contain some faults and it should be in the spectator's interest to understand and not to take everything for granted .
One should be educated to the use of television and remember that a black box should not attract completely the attention of a person. It is an instrument at the service of people and not the contrary; at the basis of its function there should be always people's will and discernment .
