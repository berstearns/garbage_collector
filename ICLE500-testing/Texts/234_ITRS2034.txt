Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
There is not much knowledge about feminism among young women. It is considered a kind of * revolution * of women against men, but it is not simply so .
This social + political movement developed during the last years of the sixties and it believed + aimed that women should have the same rights, power and opportunities as men. However this movement cannot be understood without referring to the situation of society in those years. The late sixties and early seventies were characterized by a deep crisis, which involved, politic, education, social relationships and in this context feminism set up a protest against an old-structured society ruled by men .
Feminism has old and noble origins which trace back to the French revolution. Women at that time claimed the right of being considered an important part of society, asking for civil and political rights .
In Italy during the Risorgimento, the question of feminism was still of little value, but at the end of the 19th century, due to the great number of women working in factories, the * female problem * became very important. Nevertheless what women really claimed was not only the right of working in good conditions, but they aimed at the emancipation of women as a movement of renewal of the heart of society. However women had to wait until 1945 to obtain an important success, indeed in that year they gained the right to vote. From 1945 italian population, like many others in Europe, was * busy * in * starting again *, there was a lot to do in a country destroyed by the war. This period sees the rise of the middle-class, and witnessed the so called economic * boom *. This well established middle-class still didn't give women the same opportunities as men, so in the seventies due to the ferments developed feminism broke out .
In those years women expressed their anger showing a strong rebellious aspect. They stood up for their rights in a society which didn't give them the same chances as men. They fought against male power, thus trying to destroy his role in society. They were against the old structured society where women could be mainly housewife, whereas man could study, work and chose with freedom. Unfortunately their noble ideas degenerated into a sort of extremism which spoiled their ideals, thus reducing, in some situations, their insurrection in a sterile fight between man + women for who had the duty to do the washing up, or the houseworks in the family .
In my opinion feminism was an important movement that marked a necessary break in Italian society. Thanks to those fights, now there are women free to dedicate themselves to successful careers in management, politics, science, before denied .
However these glorious conquests are only one aspect of the results obtained. The new and imposing role of women created a lack of balance in our society. Families are more and more abandoned by women interested in working many hours a day. Children are no longer educated by their mothers, but by baby-sitter, grand-parents or nursery-schools. The family isn't a strong institution any longer, and the consequences are a lack of values. Many sociologists claim that the weakening of the family and the consequent weakening of familiar bounds, are the main sources of many problems that distress our society .
So as I have analyzed the subject is controversial, because to some important conquests correspond some failures. I don't consider myself a feminist because I don't agree with the extremism they reached; but I believe that it was necessary to reach a certain freedom of choice and also to develop a certain self-consciousness which are the most important elements to be aware of our limits and our potentialities as human being .
