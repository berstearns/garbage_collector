Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The end of the 20th century is a witness to a dynamic world ruled b the development of so many different kinds of sciences and technologies that man often runs the risk of losing his control over them, even though he himself has given birth to them .
The improvement of technology and industrialization seem to proceed at the same rate as civilization, both looking for efficient services in a short time. But the rythms of industrial production, which have become part of man's life, determine some heavy consequences, such as man's alienation and loss of identity. The danger carried on is that the comfortable means of modern age may increase our mental * laziness * and contribute to our neglection of deeper values, of those spiritual ideals which require some effort to be discovered and actively cultivated. It is often easier to accept ideas from outside rather than elaborate personal thoughts .
The burst and definite ascent of * easy * technological means have dinned a purer, more genuine world, the inner self, with an invasion of pre-established images and material resources. This kind of messages is more quickly conveyable than written information, for example books. In such a practical society, images tend to prevail over the taste for conversation and reading, talking and dreaming: a state of war is set between images and imagination. It immediacy and universality of images which explain the success of this ready-made world upon man: they necessarily dominate him (unless he chooses hermitage!). Images also have a great power for persuasion, being able to reach millions of people at the same time .
There is still a place and a time for dreaming and imagining but these two dimensions are strongly threatened by powerful systems, coming from the external world. Today man's inner world seems to be tiny, restrained with respect to the overflowing magna of materialistic issues .
Reading represents one of the best ways to stimulate man's phantasy. It helps create personal images, worlds open exclusively to the reader himself. It may lead to a flight from concrete reality, and may also satisfy the reader's wish to start on imaginary journeys and meet fictional worlds, lively and coloured. If books tend to be unread, it is because one often yields to the temptation of doing actions which require less effort, like watching TV.
Nevertheless, dreaming and imagination are so deeply enrooted in man's life that no other activity will replace or destroy them. Their power is to enrich the mind with no-barrier worlds: microcosms in which man can happily lose himself, forget actual problems for a while and take shelter whenever he needs to, either when he is physically alone or when he is in the middle of a crowd .
