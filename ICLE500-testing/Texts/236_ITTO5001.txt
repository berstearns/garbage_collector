Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Probably the person who wrote this song had so much money that he did not know how to use it and, for this reason, money was perhaps more a source of anxiety than a fortune for him/her .
Anyway, nobody never died of money and, especially nowadays, having at least a small amount of money helps people to survive. More and more here in Italy you hear people talking only about money and how to make it; the State does not know what else to invent in order to make people try their luck through different games: * scrape and win *, other national lotteries, horse-racing or football pools .
Another reason for trying to make as much money as possible is that the cost of living has gone and is still going up more and more. For a middle-class family (but far more for a lower-class one !) it is not enough just a single salary to live anymore. That is why people dream a win, for instance in the lottery, in order to improve their life conditions and, if possible, to change their life completely .
Let us suppose that one morning, awakening, a person finds out he/she has won a lot of money; probably the first feeling would be of astonishment and fear, but surely then the first thing that this person will do, would be going to collect his/her money. Where is the evil in it, then ? Is there anything wrong in money itself ? Not at all .
One may object that having money sometimes leads to anxiety, fear of being robbed or swindled and to moral corruption, in the sense that the more tou have, the more you want, no matter who you trample on. This is partially true if you do not know how to make profit from your capital; it could also be objected that in that case too you could run the risk of being swindled by carrying out a wrong transaction. This is true as well, but "nothing venture, nothing have", as the saying goes .
Apropos of songs, in the text of a song written by Alanis Morrisette, a Canadian singer, "An old man turned 98, he won the lottery and died the next day". Surely money does not make happiness nor health or immortality and fate in most cases decides for you, but in any case having money let you life better without thinking always of saving, of choosing cheap (and often of poor quality) goods. Having money in a certain sense helps you also with health, because if you have a serious disease you can pay for those drugs, hospital stays and treatments you eventually need .
Moreover having money would be for poor people really a godsend. It is not necessary to remind in what conditions third-world people live. How could you say that for them "money would be the root of all evil" ? Even if we do not look so far, we perceive that also in our country there are people living on the border-line of dignity; for all these people we ought to remember the importance and the civil progress brought by money circulation in order not to waste money but to appreciate it as a divine gift and to learn to be satisfied with what we have, without profitting by other people's misfortune and misery .
