Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Since money has been introduced our life has become more practical, that it to say we do not need to have something to exchange anymore but we just need to have enough money in our wallet when we want to buy something .
In the beginning money was made up of gold, silver and precious stones and many people began to accumulate it in order to have a financila richness other than that they already have (land, house, etc.).
Notwithstanding money has brought a lot of trouble in the history of human kind. If gold had not had its value, one could assume that now the American Natives could still live in peace .
They were instead exterminated because more * civilized * people were looking for a new place to live on and were then trying to become richer with the gold that the West of America hid .
With the invention of money the differences between the rich and the poor became more and more visible. In effect if one had a possession, he/she had to have also the right amount of money to maintain it and to pay taxes. But generally the little owners could not afford all the expenses and were obliged to sell their land to people who already had great properties. So, all around the world, there were a little number of rich and a huge number of poor and destitutes. In order to try to change their awful reality big rebellions against the States and their representants were made but things did not changed too much. People gained more freedom and rights and more economic help from the State but they remained what they were before .
Because of money men made also many wars. In the past already, people fought in order to gain a plunder for themselves and, at present, things have not changed much because if there is a war it means that great economic interests lie under it. For example why did USA decide to attack Iraq so quickly and let the ex-Jugoslavian people fight for four years? One could answer: because Iraq has a thing which ex-Jugoslavia does not have, i.e. petrol .
In our modern times everything is measured with money. Time is money, people say .
Besides if you have money you have a better social status. People inconsciously think that you are a better person even if you are not. For example if you go shopping well-dressed the shop-assistents will treat you with respect but if you go badly-dressed, it does not matter if your bag is full with money, they will think you are poor, you want to buy nothing and they will consequently treat you as a second-class person .
Notwithstanding its importance there are many things that money cannot buy. Health, Love, Happyness are what every human being actually looks for in his life. To reach these goals there is no material price which can be paid. That is why in the end we are all the same. The difference is only that if one is rich, he/she can have more opportunities to achieve what he/she wants than one who has not money at all. For example Giovanni Agnelli has died because of a cancer but he had tried to be healed in America. Probably if he had being a common person, he would have suffered more and died earlier. Yet he has died. What is important to notice anyway is that he could not save himself. His money was useless in order to stop his illness .
Besides also happyness and love are well-known unacquirable * goods *. There are many rich people who have everything they want but who cannot assume they are happy and loved .
For example Kurt Cobain, the singer and leader of the group Nirvana, committed suicide in 1994 in spite of being very rich, being famous and having a wife and a daughter .
It seems, in conclusion, that what really count is the meaning we give to money. If one let money become the goal of his/her life this attitude will bring nothing but evil. Yet if one manage to consider money just as a means, he/she will be able to hold a certain distance from it and will try to achieve other aims .
Finally, if the English song says, * Money is the root of all evil *, an Italian one says, * I know money does not give happiness. But fancy how can feel one who has none at all!*
