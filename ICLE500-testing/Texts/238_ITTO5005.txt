Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
During the last two decades, we have been witnesses of a rapid development in any field of knowledge which grow more refined day after day consequently, the labour market requires skilled people more and more. It is for this reason that almost two young people in three decide to continue their studies going to the university so to improve their work opportunities. However, the value of the university degree is nowadays put in question because of several reasons .
When young people enter a university, they are aware that they are going to spend many years studing a particular area of knowledge but once in possession of the so aspired university degree they have to face many difficulties in making the transition from education to work: they find themselves not so skilled as they thought and often have to deal with demoralization and allienation .
One of the main causes derives from the fact that even though university experience open people's mind creating the cultural basis to build up a career, it focuses only on theoretical and traditional teaching and lacks of practical one. For it is true that here in Italy there exist not training programs where students may learn what are effectively the real needs of the labour market. On the contrary in Germany students are required to do them in order to acquire different strategies to turn theory into practice which will be included in their curriculum .
In a situation like the Italian one, the consequences in the labour market are essentially two. On the one hand most firms of little and medium size do not engage graduated people without some kind of practical experience because from a legal point of view they should be paid as a complete skilled workers while they have not the working knowledge required resulting in this way too much expensive and unfruitful for years. As a consequence, firms prefer non graduated people who can be paid as apprentices. On the other hand big companies which can afford higher costs induce the young to attend training courses whose aim is to introduce them into the practical work. However, being engaged by this companies is not so easy: competition is very strong and only few people have access to these employments .
Being in the van is then another actual problem which involves both Universities and students who are placed in this sense in a position of disadvantage with respect to their peers of foreign countries. This is due basically to a lack of strong connections between universities and the employment world and to a general cultural closure towards experiments and new ideas. It is well known that researchers in italian universities are too limited and traditional and that the most intelligent brains here encounter serious obstacles in developing their new theories or techniques .
Therefore, they are forced to migrate abroad where universities, supported by industry, give men means and instruments to develop their creativity in order to make new discoveries and to apply them in practical working. It is no without reason that U.S. universities as well as their students are considered the most advanced in keeping up to date with developments in any field of study .
Consequently, italian graduated are handicapped from this point of view: they receive only a traditional teaching which, alhtough of great importance, is not sufficient in assuring a competitive knowledge in the labour market. Thus, graduated are often obliged to attend refreshing programs abroad spending further time and money .
In conclusion, universities should make efforts to establish strong cooperative relationships with the labour market introducing innovative new approaches to teaching such as trainings and experimental programs which can build more valuable and competitive skills .
