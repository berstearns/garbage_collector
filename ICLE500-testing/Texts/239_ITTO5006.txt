Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
During the Roman Empire who used to own a great deal of * pecus *, that is to say who breeded cattle, was considered rich compared to the slaves who had nothing. Consequently the word * pecus * developed into the one of * pecunia * with the meaning of richness, as we are used to consider it today. As a result, owning money man had the possibility to lighten his way to build up a decent life going for instance to a good school in order then to get a good job. Despite this, man has also seen how, throughout history, his possessions and his never-ending will of having always more have also become the root of all his evil. Therefore, why do not we finally consider the case of finding a happy balance between the two choices?
There is no doubt that man has an inner will which pushes him to obtain always something more from his capability, and money does not certainly stop this push. As a matter of fact, our modern and superficial society leads us towards buying, obtaining and possessing always more in order to be always happier. But doing so man has been reduced to a colourful, beautiful, brightly, but empty box whose appearance attracts whoever walks on the side-walk. Apropos of this, already in the 17th century Shakespeare asked himself if being or having was a solvable problem or not. The reflections of his far thoughts should be read in today's newspapers concerning the use one makes of money. How much money was spent for instance to build up soccer stadiums before the latest world championship? How about the money spent by the MAFIA to enrich its powerful and unmoral pockets? And the money spent in the illegal children trade from coast to coast of our different countries? Without continuing the list, there is no doubt that only considering the material and reluctant aspect of having money one tends to forget that before having one needs of being .
Nevertheless there is always the other part of the coin, which in this case shows how money can most of the time make people happy. And going back to the previous meaning of the word * pecunia *, it is easy to think that without something to possess and to trade, as it was for cattle, men could not eat and live. One needs to work in order to earn a certain amount of money and then live in a good way. This does not necessairly mean that one must be eager for gain, as a matter of fact there are lots of rich people that help and have helped the needed. It is shown, for instance, from various international pop singers who give part of their earnings to the third world populations. In addition, who does not remember the charitable and good works done by Lady Diana while living? And she was the future England's King wife!
Furthermore, one should step lower from the rich and famous people and see how much one can do from our less rich positions. If we had not had the right amount of money we could not face the university studies. We could not have gone to foreign countries and see the beautiful cities spread over the world. Not only can we better ourselves with money, but can we also help other people. Do we forget how many families adopting orphan children have helped them build up a new life? This has been possible not only because the future parents had a good heart, but also because money helped them to do it .
Therefore it may be concluded that doubless for many years in the past and for many years to come money could be considered the root of man's evil, but as it has been seen it is not always so. As a matter of fact is not completely true. Money and good will can cooperate to build up a good life and finding the right balance between the two one could also modify the famous book title * To have or to be?* by the psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, into * to have AND to be *.
