Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
The word * money * is one of the most common ones in songs, books, newspapers and every day conversations. Everything that sorrounds us can be * translated * into money, everything has its own price .
A well-known motto says that money does not make happiness, but as we know, it can be useful! Moreover, another statement has to be kept in mind: it is better being in good health than having a lot of money. It is not always true that if you can pay for your treatments you will surely be better, as the touching case of Giovanni Alberto Agnelli has recently shown. Money is undoubtedly the means by which people can grant their own desires. But what are they? A new powerful car, a big house, beautiful clothes, but also other people freedom or institutions. When someone gets used to buy everything this becomes a sort of * illness *. If there is a problem money is the only solution, money becomes the key which opens every door. People pay for being privilegiate, for cancelling accuses, for a better appearance and so on, as famous political men and actors always show .
Money should be used for noble purposes, but, in many cases, this is not true. Everyone thinks at its own pleasures forgetting the rest of the world. So there are case of rich people who pay judges not to be condemned for their crimes and often innocent men or women pay the consequences. Not to speak about moral corruption money can bring. People who can afford every kind of pleasures are never satisfied and want always more; so it is common the use of alcohol and drugs to reach the highest level of emotions. It is a never ending circle which brings to unbelievable facts, like selling everything one person owns or having a great deal of debts .
Another aspect linked to money is the behaviour of people who do not own much money or, worse, who have nothing and live in indigence. Someone tries to improve its state with its own strenghts, other get worst and making money becomes the only reason of their life. So these people start ?bedding? and even stealing. They can eve kill in order to make money. To this trend many offences are connected and it is difficult to say whether illegal acts are due to the need of money or money is so powerful to corrupt human souls .
It is too easy saying that money is the root of evil, it is not always true. Men are often the major causes for evil actions, their aspirations and desires drive them to commit crimes. Money must be taken apart, it is our fault not its. Our nature is too feable to resist to temptations, that is why we hide ourselves behind abstract concepts. Money can be the root either for evil and for good: it is up to us making a choice .
