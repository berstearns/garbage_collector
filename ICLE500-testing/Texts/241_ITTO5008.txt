Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
In all probability university students wonder whether or not they spend their time uselessly in studying through four or five years in order to take their degree. it is necessary to underline that there are some university degrees which are more theoretical than practical and which aim more at enriching culturally student ' minds than preparing them to enter the real world. The university degrees which are more theoretical than practical are the Art Faculties degrees such as degree in History, Philosophy, Modern and Classical Languages; on the contrary university degrees which are more practical than Art Faculties are Medical Faculty, Engeneering Faculty and Business Administration Faculty .
The degrees in Medicine and Business Administration give the possibility to students to do training courses in hospitals and in enterprises in order to help them to become more familiar with the world of business. Take the instance of Arianna Cataldo, a friend of mine who last year took her degree in Business Administration and now works as secretary in an enterprise in Turin. During her four years university course, she had to do training courses in different enterprises where she learnt to use computers and to keep enterprises accountings. Consequently, last year when she obtained her degree, she quickly found a job as secretary in one of the four enterprises where she worked during training courses .
In the medicine Faculty, students are obliged to do practical courses in hospitals, in fact it is not sufficient to pass all theoretical exams to get a degree in Medicine. Take the instance of Marcella Vittorini, a friend of mine who would obtain a degree in Medicine. Every day she does practical hours at the C.T.O Hospital of Turin. She tells me that practical hours are very usefull in order to understand better medical theories and to understand in what consist the doctor's work. She find practical courses very important in order to become more familiar with her future work .
In general, Arts Faculties initiate students into the teaching career. People are persuaded that being a teacher is easier than being a secretary and consequently they are convinced that practical courses are unnecessary. Take the instance of Jane Morris: ten years ago Jane got a first-class honours degree in history at Cambridge University and two years ago she found a job as history teacher in a Secondary School in London. Last year she was dismissed because the students complained to the headmaster about the fact that she was not able to explain the historical events .
She never explained History but obliged her students to study it on books by themselves .
Consequently, the dismissal of Jane gave rise to controversies about the fact that the Humanities degrees are more theoretical than practical . Final year students should have the possibility to do temporary teaching jobs or should work as teachers' assistants in order to become more friendly with students but above all with the subject which they are going to teach in future .
As far as modern languages degree is concerned, it lacks in specialized courses which may be useful to students who are going to find a job as interpreter in enterprises. the languages courses focus their attention more on literature than on language. In fact there are more literature exams than language ones. Moreover there are not courses about Business English, Business French, Business German or Business Spanish which I consider essential in order to find a job as interpreter .
furthermore, there are no computer courses or courses specialized in translations. When you have an interview the employer does not ask you to talk about Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde, but he usually asks you whether or not you know how to use a computer and whether or not you are familiar with business English, for instance. Take the instance of my aunt Emilia. She took her degree in English language ten years ago. When she went for an interview, she was not recruited because she was unfamiliar with Business English and computers. The employer preferred to recruit a girl who only held a school-learning certificate but who was excellent in using computers and in writing Business English .
Art Faculties ought to open students' minds not only theoretically but also practically by introducing into the degree programme specialised exams more linked to the practical world of business than to the theoretical world of culture .
