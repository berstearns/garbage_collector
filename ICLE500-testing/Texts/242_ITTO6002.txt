Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
In the last few years many intellectuals have begun questioning whether the feminist * revolution * has improved women's conditions or not. It is undeniable that many feminists have exaggerated: for example, in the sixties thousands of women burnt their brasses as a sign of protest .
Nowadays this would seem ridicolous, since femininity is now considered a value and not something to be ashamed of. However they have had the merit of pointing out the many discriminations suffered by women at the time and of fighting for being considered equal to men in their rights and opportunities. Therefore, the feminist movement should be seen as a good attempt, partially successful, toward a more equalitarian society; and every woman today should be grateful to those women who have fighted for their rights .
Until the end of the sixties, women in the western world lived in a difficult and unfair situation. Their role was that of mothers and wives and their attempts to improve their social status through a job and a career were deliberately stopped by men. Women were told since their childhood that their fulfilment as a human being could come only from being good mothers and marrying a rich man. They were also told that going to the university and reaching a good level of instruction was unnecessary, since jobs such as doctors or lawyers were not appropriate for them. But this sad state of affairs was about to change; students and intellectuals started to fight for their rights and amidst them many women found the strength of raising the question of their status. It suddenly became a movement on its own, involving thousands of women and lasting several years .
Nowadays, the situation has changed under several aspects. Women have more or less the same opportunities of men. A woman lawyer or surgeon is no longer something unusual. Women may decide to devote their lives to a career, rather than their family. In many countries, governments have introduced laws in defence of women's rights. In Italy, for instance, the Parliament in the early seventies legalised the abortion, prompted by the feminists' fights. This has been considered one of the main victories of the feminist movement in our country .
In conclusion, it seems clear that the new opportunities which women have nowadays are the result of the feminist movement. Without their fights and perhaps without the excesses, too, women today would find themselves more or less in the same situation of thirty years ago .
