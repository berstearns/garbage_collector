Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
One of the main problems of the last decade of our century is that of the feminist movement. Since the end of the eighteenth century women started trying to change their role in the society, but a real turning point seems to have been the sixties of our century. As usual there are people in favour and other against this movement. On one side stay people who think that feminists have just caused more problems to the society, for example creating a sort of confusion of roles between men and women and all the consequences that this confusion leads. On the other side are those who think that this movement have improved women's conditions, according to this idea their conditions have changed in better. Actually women went out their sort of jail in where they were obliged to live until our century: they started having their own ideas, they stared working, to vote and to have the same opportunities men have .
Women have ameliorated their way to live from many points of view: one is the act to think by their own, this is the first step to become independent, to have their own ideas about what is right or wrong for them is a good staring point for the movement. A second important point concerns the job: only working women can gain independence from their husbands and moreover can play an active role in the society; according this last idea, it is important to remember one of the biggest conquests that women have obtained, the right to vote, which allowed them to express their opinions about problems of the society .
More recently a revolt of the feminist movement took shape: during the 60's women reacted against the way society treated them, they claimed for more * independence from the house * they wanted to be something more than only a wife or mother, they did not want no more to stay at home waiting for their husbands, they wanted their husbands to help them with the house and the children .
Another reason of their revolt concerned discrimination at work, women were subjected to many falls: for example they could be faired because they were pregnant or they were subjected to sexual harassments by their boss and, in most of the cases, they were not recognized; moreover women could not denounce the falls because as a consequence they would have lost their job .
In conclusion feminists have made a lot of progresses in the last years; without any doubts women's conditions have improved thanks to this movement: today a woman has got quite the same opportunities a man has and most of the same rights, and what is missing it will be surely gain in the future .
