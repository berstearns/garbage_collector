Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Mary Wollstonecraft indicating the rights of woman was simply extending radical ideas to the situation of women. Feminist movement, which some years after developed, took origins from radical ideas and it was therefore a radical movement that led to relevant changes in the world of women. Thanks to feminists women have now the same political rights and obligations as men, they can receive the same education men have and they can work; but in spite of this woman is not completly not at the same level as men just because feminists wanted to make women similar to men forgetting they are not similar but different. In other words, since feminist movement claimed that woman should behave as nearly as possible like man, it did not improve women condition .
It is undeniable that feminism was dedicated to bringing the lives of woman somewhat nearer to ideal perfection and to make woman similar to man. From this point of view they wanted to deprive the male of his power to obtain the power for themselves. But what they did not bear in mind was the was the fact that they are not equal but similar, individually different but always complementary. With the conquer of power woman's condition did not better because women must do what men usually did .
Another important point is that work women do nowadays is doubled compared to the one they did in the past. In other words, they are involved not only with children care and household, but also with their job. Long hours of hard phisical or mental work are a necessity for many women, especially in single-parent family, in which woman is the only bread-winners. In the past, instead, woman was asked only to be a mother and a wife. In a way feminism has completly disregarded the basic principle of the woman as angel of the home .
Thirdly, one of the issue raised by feminists is that women should have the opportunities as men and be subject to exactly the same social and political treatment as men. This struggle has not been won. In fact women are often discriminated just because they are women and could be pregnant. Moreover, some kind of jobs are still made by men, as for example the religious career or airplain pilots (to mention only some of them). Also in politics women are not so well represented: as a matter of fact the majority of politicians are men .
Last but not least feminist movement, the fight for women's right, is seen as a luxury for poor women in developing countries and considered a western ideology. In many countries in Africa and Asia women are the main farmers and also the perform most of the housework. In some families women are in charge of all the farming work because the men have migrated to towns in search of paid jobs. Studies carried out that woman is an ignored part of the economy, despite the fact that they work harder and longer than men .
In conclusion, although years of fights feminist movement had had more negative effects than positive ones because we must bear in mind that a female who tries to achieve masculinity (that is what feminists wanted to do) is psychologically ill in the same way as a male tries to achieve femininity .
