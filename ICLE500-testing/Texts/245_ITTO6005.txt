Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Since modern times women have had to strive to prove their worth in front of the society, indeed the social importance, merit and role of men was taken for granted, while women were considered as * alleged culprits * and therefore supposed to show up their value. Did they not have the right to fight to prove the world they were equal to men? Some might say that feminists have taken this struggle to the extreme, and so now they have to face even too many responsibilities. But it's undoubtedly true that without their committment women's emancipation would not have gone so far .
The first complains about women's situation within the society can be found in the work of Mary Wollestonecraft * Vindications of women's rights * (that would have later become the Feminists' Manifesto): at this stage the dispute was meant to establish an equality between the two sexes only in terns of moral and intellectual values. But she was already considered as an extremist by the men of her time, so deeply attached to their * angels of the fireplace *. Was it not better for them to have as their only preoccupation their little world inside their house and no larger than that?
Evidently the principles spread by the French Revolution were gradually affecting women's mind, because they were starting feeling the need of being considered as integrant and autonomous parts of the society in which they lived. This meant the vindication of civil, legal and political rights. The right to vote became in fact the first goal to reach for the movement of the so-called * suffragettes * (obtained in 1918 in Great Britain and in 1920 in the United States).
In wartime then being a woman meant a double role: adoring her man and taking his place at work. On the other hand the philosophies of the totalitarian regimes fostered the ideal of manliness, the role of * pater familias * and the physical strenght as far as men were concerned, while women were relegated to the role of mothers of little armies of children (possibly male) who would have served their motherland. On the other hand, they could not only accomplish this subordinated role, because they even had to take their husbands' places at work to earn their living (and obviously to help their motherland economy). This meant to be unofficially active in society (unofficially because not recognized as such). This led to big struggles during the years around 1968, when the Feminist Movement took on his hardest form: women started even thinking that they could bring up their children without the figure of a father present to them, that abortion was only a woman's choice, that omosexuality was the only possible answer to men's degeneration, so on and so forth.	Naturally these are extremes positions, the right measure should lie in between. The problem that, thanks to the feminists of all times, women have now achieved several rights, but they have even taken on several (if not too many) responsibilities: they keep on having the roles of angel of the house and of mother, but moreover they have a job now, and possibly some spare time to dedicate to themselves and to their interests. So what could be called the * women's burden * is the fact to be not AS men, but even MORE. And this is due to the fact that while a woman's roles have been increasing, often a man's ones have not followed this path, and certainly not at this pace. What feminists maybe did not do is convincing men they should change and mature alongside with women .
In conclusion, if nowadays a woman in a civilized society can choose her way into the world and have the possibility of self-fulfilment, this is undeniably owed mostly to feminists of all times .
