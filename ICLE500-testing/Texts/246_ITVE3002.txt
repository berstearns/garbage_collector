Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The word which is mostly applied to our society is * materialistic * and the typical description of modern man is certainly sad: always hurrying to work, always trying to earn as much money as possible and always thinking that people who are not strong enough to fight for their place in the world will certainly meet with failure. Therefore it is undeniable that our society does not give us many opportunities of freeing our imagination and dreaming: but does this mean that we do not want to dream any longer? Would not we sometimes give everything we own to have a few hours to lay down and read a book or listen to our favourite music? Many people would answer that what we really need is to be efficient and * produce * as much as possible, but I believe that what we should be does not always correspond with what we wish to be .
First, I would like to consider all those new techniques and methods which are becoming very successful and which have the purpose of restoring the contact between man and the deepest part of himself. I am speaking about yoga or the New Age philosophy of life, which both aim at teaching how to forget the daily stress, how to concentrate and relax and, above all, how to rediscover the power of human mind. More and more people are applying to the many courses which take place in big and small cities, thus showing their deep unfulfilment, their need of discovering a new aspect of life and, above all, of setting their mind free .
The second reason why I think that modern man is still trying to find a way toward dreams and imagination is that he is willing to learn how to appreciate the value of a close contact with nature. Those people who can afford it leave their sad flat in town and go to live in the country. Big towns are seen as places where human mind is never * at leisure *, never goes * on holiday *, whereas in the country our imagination is free to wander, our eyes reach the horizon line and start thinking about the world beyond it. Many people are also getting involved in programmes which aim at protecting the few * uncontaminated * areas of our planet, the ones which man has not reached yet, which are seen as the only places where human mind can recreate itself. All this proves that the contrast between what is * natural * and what is * artificial *, which was created during the Industrial Revolution to give voice to man's horror toward the destruction of nature and its beauty as a source of happiness, is still crucial today .
As a third and fundamental thing I would like to take into consideration those phenomenons such as drugs-addiction or alcoholism, which I see as extreme methods to find a way-out from our hectic modern life. We know that hallucinogenic drugs and alcohol can give people the impression of entering another world, where everything is easy and relaxing: these are the * new dreams *, this is the proof that human mind, still in need of something more than what money can buy, is trying to find a help, unfortunately in the wrong way .
As a conclusion, I want to say that even if in our modern world there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, they still have a place inside us all, because it is man who does not want to destroy them .
