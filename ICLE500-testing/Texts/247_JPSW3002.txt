Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
I believe that listening and speaking are more important than grammar. Even if we don't speak using accurate grammar, if we just tell several words, a listener can understand intention of us. A leaner must feel something if s/he can understand what a speaker says and can tell their feeling. The emotion could be surprise or happiness. That is, it makes a deep impression on them. And then, these emotions become pleasure of learning English. Because of the emotions, a learner starts to think that s/he wants to speak and communicate more, and then I suspect that motivation and interest will come out from there .
One day I asked one native speaker something but before she answered, she told me that my speaking was like interviewer. I intended that I spoke naturally because the sentence that I used was one of sentences from my textbook, therefore I was very shocked and too shy when I was told that. It means that even if I study grammar a lot, I make a listener feel strange once in a while. Therefore I believe from these reasons that it's very important to learn listening and speaking .
 I think that oral approach is very important for especially beginner. A teacher makes learners repeat again and again to learn to pronounce English. It's better to carry on a class with a few students because a teacher can grasp understanding of students easily and also to increase opportunities of their speaking .
 By the way, although I have told about importance of listening and speaking so far, if a learner doesn't study grammar, s/he would reach a wall which is named limit. English has grammar rules like math. Therefore a teacher tells the grammar rules clearly and simply. And then, tell them again and again until a learner gets tired of listen. Because of repeat a lot, a learner remembers the rules and s/he will be able to find a point which needs to be careful by themselves. And also, it's good way too to make a sentence that is easy. And after, let a learner to memorize it. If they memorize it, they can transpose the other words and can apply .
 They are important for students to lay the foundation of English and to be impressed that English is fun. Therefore, a teacher should teach again and again using easy words or sentences and also should be always positive and keep class interesting. Teachers should make a point of student activity. They need to thinka class that students are given opportunity to speak English a lot and also they need to think of activities which are full of variety. Before they carry on class, they need to understand point of guidance that government decided. At least they must comprehend correctly a goal of the grade that they take charge of .
Lastly, I would like to say one more thing. Teachers properly endeavor to make progress with the leaner and it's most desirable that teacher also learn from learners and enjoy a class together.
