Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
Today English is widely used among many people in the world. The necessity of that people can use English is clearly rising. Now many students, adults, even little children are learning English at a school or special school like an English conversation school in Japan. But acquiring English in the native country is not easy. Some learners of English have difficulty in learning English before they reach proficient level. Then what are the most important factors in successful language learning? It's not intelligence and aptitude. Some individuals have an exceptional aptitude for language learning. But I think that the answer is motivation and attitude. High levels of motivation and positive attitude are correlated with success in language acquisition. And successful learning enhances motivation. I believe that .
The principal way that teachers can influence students' motivation is by making the classroom a supportive environment in which students are stimulated, engaged in activities which are appropriate to their age, interests, and English level. And most important thing is that students can experience success. So English teachers need to devise their classes to make interesting and effective classes so that their students can be interested in English and progress their English well .
How class is interesting and effective for students? It's a student-centered class. Some English teachers don't give their students many opportunities to speak in English. In English class, teacher should not be a center of the class and should give students many opportunities to use English as much as possible. And it's important for teachers to make a good atmosphere that all students can speak their opinions or thoughts freely .
When I was a high school student, all English teachers taught us in Japanese. They hardly spoke English except for reading textbook. And they applied traditional method like a grammar translation. The focus was on the language itself, rather than on information which is carried by the language. The teachers' goal was to see to it that students learned the vocabulary and grammatical rules of English. And the goal of students, including me, was to pass an entrance examination for university rather than to use English for daily communicative interaction. So I guess that most of the students couldn't speak English well .
I think that English teachers should teach in English. I, of course, want to teach in English. The English class in the high school (and junior high school) is only place where students can learn useful English. Many students go to a supplementary private school and study English but the taught things there are only grammar and the way to get good score in English examination or test. So English teachers in high school have to teach more practical English .
In many school, the most widely applied method is no doubt the grammar translation method. But this teaching method is inadequate for English acquisition. I think that teachers should many opportunities to engage in conversational interactions in group and paired activities. These activities will be able to lead to increased fluency and the ability to manage conversations in English .
I heard the news that new school where focuses English would be established in Kanto soon. In the school, other subjects will be taught in English. The number of such the school may increase in future. English teachers will need higher English skills to teach. I will study hard and contribute to students' English learning as an English teacher.
