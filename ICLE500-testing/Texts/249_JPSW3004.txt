Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
"Today, we are going to study lesson 3. Please open your text book, page 12. This lesson's key point is ..." This is typical English class in Japan. Teacher talks too much in class. Teacher's too much English speaking leads students to dreamland! What do they learn in wonderful dreamland? English class is not the stage that teacher practices speaking English. The leading actor and actress on the stage are students. They are expected to express themselves by speaking English, and communicate with each other by English in class. Teacher can help them so that their conversation goes well. This paper explains how teacher should teach English efficiently .
 The most important thing when we learn something is motivation. Students should be motivated to study English. Teacher needs to teach them not only how to learn English but also how to do it with interest. In class, various activities help students to enjoy learning English. They are prompted to speak English by activity. It is effective to arrange appropriate setting that students experience in everyday life, when they communicate with each other in activity. A common situation (conversation at shopping, party, restaurant etc) gets them to be comfortable to think something in English. Also it is necessary to determine an aim of activity, in other words, teacher has to make students figure out what they should learn in it. Activity is not English play, but English learning .
Role play is one of the activities. The following is example of it .
 "Where do you want to go?" (for high school student)
 Setting of language use:communication in group
 Setting of communication: a travel agency
 Function of language:to state one's opinion or thought
 Task: to solve problems with English
[Teaching process] 
1) Divide class into three people ' group .
2) Each student is given different task, but a student doesn't know two other student's task .
Travel agent: He /she recommend customers to go to England. It's the most expensive travel plan .
Customer 1(Husband): He wants to go to Korea, because trip to Korea doesn't cost much money .
Customer 2(Wife): She is eager to go to America. She really wants to see Statue of Liberty .
3) Learn conversation style of travel agency . (Handout is prepared as the case may be.)
4) Start role play in each group. At the end, some groups are supposed to do role play in front of the class .
Student can learn skill for communication through speaking English. Cooperative learning in class room helps them to sustain their conversation .
Every student has two screens in their brain. One is for Japanese, the other is for English. They use those screens when they think and speak something. When students speak English, they think what they want to say in Japanese at first. They project what they are trying to say on the Japanese screen. Then they translate what they want to say from Japanese into English. They project what they are trying to say in English on the English screen. Teacher has to help students to think what they want to say in English from the first. Through many activities, they will come to get used to speaking English and think something in English by only using English screen. Therefore, Teacher should make student speak English in class instead of he/she .
