Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
In recent years, English is called "world language" and people of all over the world speak in English when they talk with people of another country. Therefore, we have to use English for having communication with them. The pivot of conventional Japanese method of teaching English was learning about grammar, so although many learners could answer grammar questions, they couldn't speak and listen in English. From on now, English is not learning but using .
First, I think that it is very important for us to learn English in English. Why did Japanese English teachers teach English in Japanese? We mastered Japanese in Japanese, so English learners should master in English like that children who speak in English master English. I think that Oral Approach is one of very good method because all classes don't have to do in English. If Japanese is needed in the class, teachers can use Japanese at that time. Doing in English all the class is very wonderful, but it is very difficult. Teaching English grammar in English is difficult, so it is difficult for learners to understand in English. Therefore, of course, using Japanese is functional when it needs. I think that because listening is one step of speaking, so I want to do the classes in English as much as possible .
Second, it is important to be able to use English everywhere, every time. For that, teachers have to prepare learners to have many opportunities speaking and listening in English. There are many situations using in English, for example, telephone, sightseeing, shopping, restaurant, and so on. Therefore, I think that English activity is very important because activity doesn't have correct answer, so they are free to do various things. Learners can say own feelings and opinion in English, and then, they will become to use English for communication. Then, reading and writing in English are very important, too. I think that using English is that they can tell own opinion and feeling to another people in English. It is not answer grammar questions correctly, remember a lot of idioms and words for exam. Certainly, having a lot of vocabularies is very useful, but that should increase naturally when they use in English. The most important thing is having a lot of opportunities to use English .
Third, I think that learners have to understand own and spoken English country's cultures. Using English, they have to know some of that country's customs. For example, the gesture differ each country, so if I don't know that difference, I will make a big mistake. Therefore, while learners talk with a native speaker, I want to teach them the native speaker's cultures and customs. Because of the native speaker, this way must be learned real things. And then, if learners learn any languages, they have to understand own cultures and customs because they will have many opportunities introducing own cultures when they talk with people of another country. I think that it is important for learners to understand cross-cultural in English class .
In conclusion, using English is very pleasant because you will be able to see all over the world if you master English. I have a part-time job to teach English for children. The children who learn English are very enjoyable and their eyes are bright as diamond. I think that the important thing is learners feel learning English is pleasure. I want to become a teacher who is able to tell English is very wonderful!
