Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
I should teach speaking or conversation at first, because it is difficult for Japanese to deal with have a conversation. So, I put emphasis on speaking rather than grammar to the beginning learner. Until quite recently, systems of education in Japan have a course such that teachers teach students grammar and vocabulary at the beginning. Recently, we come to have a little opinion of this course. An educational institution put forward that speaking is also important, and teaches should teach grammar and vocabulary and speaking. As compared with another foreigner, speaking is a weak point than writing and reading for Japanese . 
Now, English is introduced at junior high school in Japan. But, other foreign country is introduced English or other foreigner at primary school. In Japan, introduction of English is too late. I should think when children start school, children should learn English at the same time, and children learn other subject .
 I should that the emphasis is on play and enjoyment, rather than formal language teaching at primarily level. So, I want to use task and activity in everyday lesson. I think that students are able to fluent. Teachers teach students formal English or accuracy little by little. Fluency, accuracy and complexity are not learned together. Until now, curriculums of Japan emphasized accurate rather than fluency. A result, Japanese is not fluency rather than other foreigner. Because Japanese stand to attention grammar and mistakes so as to make mistakes. So, students learn fluency accuracy and complexly in sequence. That is to say learners can fluent, teachers teach grammar and reform mistakes. After that teachers teach complexly step by step .
I should think that teachers accept using English to teach other subject in curriculums at primary and second level. For example, at primary level teachers adopt incorporating English vocabulary and simple phrases, sentences and instruction into every day classroom. At the secondary, teachers use English as much as students can understand in other curriculums. Of course, teachers should use English all the time in school lesson .
I think that learner should start studying as soon as possible, and they should enjoy studying foreign language. So teacher give students to teach English with enjoyable. I don't teach grammar or vocabulary but attention of foreign language. Because, I am happy when I could have a communication with other foreigner. And I think that communication is very important. If I will a teacher, I teach students English of real situation, and I use tape recorder because of commune with natural to English. It is important that students think to enjoy studying English. Therefore, teachers teach students such as feeling of English
