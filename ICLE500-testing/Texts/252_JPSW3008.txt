Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
This time I want to think about teaching English. When I was high school student, I liked to study English, but I didn't like English class because how to teach English by teacher did not interest me. Therefore, I was bored and sometimes slept in English class. Now, from my experiences as student I want to give three ideas of teaching English .
First, teacher should be communicating with students well. It is not good that teacher just speak one-side because to just listen to teachers talking is too boring, and students will not be interested in English classes. In actual, they translate English into Japanese themselves, so student's English skills will not be better. Also it is good for students to tell their opinions and feelings because their English skills will improve well for doing so. To present their opinions and talk with teacher will make an impression for students, so students will not forget easy. Moreover, if what students say in English can tell the other students and teacher, they can feel that English is fun and it interests them. For these reasons, I think that communication between teacher and students is very important .
Second, I think that it is good to see and hear natural English. I think that Assistant English teachers who are English native speakers are good for students because students can learn a lot of how to talk from not only textbook also daily conversation with native speaker. Then, native speaker's pronunciation and attitude are different from Japanese, so they act as encouragement to students. For that reason, teacher had better give a lot of chances for students to talk with native speaker. Also, Japanese teacher had better speak English fluently because students imitate teacher's pronunciations. If teacher's pronunciation is not good, student cannot improve their pronunciation of English well, like this I think that teacher should speak natural English. For these reasons, to experience native or natural English is good for students .
Third, all of students should always join classes. I think that students had better feel a little tension in their classes because if they do not feel tension, they don't think well themselves. It is best that teacher make an atmosphere both friendly and tense. Though it is hard that there is a mood of nervous, students will step up their English skills for being call on them. If they don't answer correct, they can learn from mistaking. For that reason, teacher had better put some pressure on their students. Moreover, to pronounce all of students together is good because students will learn for pronouncing again and again, and they can understand well. For these purposes, teacher should have students joining classes well . 	My ideas of teaching English are to communicate with students, to be experienced natural English for students, and to be joined class for students. If teacher do these things, I think students can learn and understand English better.
