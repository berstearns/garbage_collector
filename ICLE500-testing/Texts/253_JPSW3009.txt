Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
Now, it is said the internationalization society. The exchange with foreign country is active in a lot of fields. So it is necessary to study and use English that is common language. To study English is to understand different culture in the country where English is spoken. To understand different culture is to understand your culture again too. That is to say, you can have new view and a lot of ways of thinking. For the purpose, I consider how English should be taught .
It is important to make students have their motivation. There is a difference at the level and the speed on learning English between students who learned from the same teacher in same class. The reason for this is that there is difference in the motive in the learning environment of students. It is important factor for learner to have motivation. Then, how can we have students improve motive. First, from recognition states, we should give a clear objection (we should say today's contents at the beginning of the class.) and summary (at the end of class). Second, from affective states, we should give chance that students speak English in class and curiosity that is connected with motive. We should not use negative word. Teaching English in more positive attitude than a negative attitude brings students better learning results .
There are fifteen teaching methods for teaching English. Each method has both good point and weak point. These methods compensate each weak point. There is no perfect method. We should study correctly view and insistence of each method. It is necessary not to be prepossessed with one method, to assemble a lot of method. We should teach with method of suitable our own method in each case and suit level of students to our class. For example, Grammar Translation Method is a method that we teach rules of grammar and apply this to students and students translates from English to Japanese or translates from Japanese to English. Good point of this method is easy for student who uses fully Japanese to understand. Also, weak point of this method is that students can't acquire English operation ability because focus of class is translation and students can't study listening, speaking and pronunciation in class. This method is suitable for high level students. The load of teacher is light. Students can study writing and reading well. So, we should adopt only good point and compensate listening and speaking skills by other methods .
For carrying out this plan, we need to study hard everyday, for example, we should read English news paper and listening to English radio and watch English program TV. And apply ability for teaching students English. Before everything, it is important to think everything from the student's point of view and teach in a kind manner.
