Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
Speaking and listening are important. They are essential in communication. I think that English learning is not only to learn language but also communication. Speaking and listening are the very first step to master English, so we should have more conversation practices in class. I often hear that if we want to improve our English skills as soon as impossible, we should go to America, England, or Australia. In other words, if we listen and speak much as if we live in these countries, I'm sure we can improve English skills. I want to say again, we should have many conversation practices .
When I was junior high or high school student, I didn't speak English so much. Teachers spoke mostly and we students spoke only a little Japanese. I didn't have chances to practice conversations in English only a few times. It was not enough. At college I had "speaking and listening" class for the first time and I was requested to speak English during an activity in the class. I had not had conversation practice before, so I was very confused. What did the teacher say? What should I answer the question? Actually, I didn't catch even a very easy sentence, for example, !What did you do yesterday?" Then, I wondered why I had studied grammar which was not so useful in communication. I always didn't like to study grammar because it was a little difficult to understand. Also, I learned it was not so useful. The fact was irritating for me. I felt I was a student who couldn't keep up with the others and the class level. I lost my motivation to study English. Now I don't feel so. Now I think grammar is also important. But I learned from my experience that if he or she feels what they studied is useless, they will lose their motivations and stop to improve their skills .
We should have many practices of conversation and speeches in earlier education, junior high school. If they are not successful, it is OK! Failures or mistakes are good rather than successes, because we will have many mistakes during communication. Important thing is how we can solve the problems. Failures will lead to successes .
Also, the atmosphere is so quiet in class. It is difficult for students to ask questions or say their opinions in such a quiet place. If they don't speak English, they will never be able to speak it. To say own opinions is very important in American culture. Teacher should tell about it and pay attention to atmosphere of class. English should be taught in cheerful atmosphere and we should have many, many practices of conversations .
