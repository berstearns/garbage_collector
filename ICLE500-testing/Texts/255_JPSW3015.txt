Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
I have been learned English since I was junior school student. But I couldn't communicate with English speaking people at that time. I learn English I want to speak more fluently. Although teacher taught me English to use textbook almost every day, I didn't remember of their lesson. So teacher should not teach by only textbook .
First, I think that teachers should help students to have their motivation. For example, they teach that English is good way of communication with all over the world or something. Because I still do not master English skill. It's not teachers fault. I didn't think strongly that I want to speak English in the future. So I think that their feelings help their study if students have motivation to English. Second, I think that most important thing is teaching English enjoyably. I think that students will become don't like English if teacher is so strict. And student will be bored by she or he teach in accordance with only textbook or examination. So I want that students will have interest in English. Then I prepare some materials for keeping student's concentration. For instance, the case of word test, teachers change usual test on paper to word bingo or games. Third, I think that English education of junior senior high school in Japan that take a leading part of grammar. Some of schools, which studying English for examination. Although grammar is important, I think that studying grammar is not perfect right way to be able to speak English. So after I teach one grammar point, students make sentence to use new grammar. I want to teach useful English in the future. For example, student will get opportunity of speak in the class or speak new grammar sentence. Therefore I need to create an atmosphere that students can open their mouth in the class. I think that students will have confidence to speak English if they keep on speaking since they are first year. Finally, I think that student should have listening ability. Because I can't communicate if I don't understand what the other person said even I can say my opinions or feelings. I thought that English is difficult when I was junior high school student. I think that I was afraid of English because I didn't get used to listening English. So students need to listen English because of they get rid of their feeling like mine. Therefore I think that teacher should have better teach to use Oral Approach. Teacher can use both of Japanese and English in that way .
I think that teachers have energy to teach for students. I heard that teachers often use negative word in the class. I think it is one of fact that students don't like or willing to study English. I think that it is fault of teachers to students can not understand. So I will not want to say that why do you understand. I want to be a teacher who has respect for each student and never gives up for teach. I want to teach English accurately, so that I should learn about English and other knowledge.
