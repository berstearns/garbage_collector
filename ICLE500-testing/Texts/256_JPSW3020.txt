Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
We should develop our ability to speak English. Certainly, It is emphasized by a lot of people, but actually even if almost all the Japanese people study English, they can not speak English fluently or can not understandEnglish. If we overcome this serious problem, we can get native speaker's thought. In other words, this is the first step to get ability of language. Now there are three ways to make full use of practicing .
 First, we should watch TV programs (e.g. CNN, BBC, ABC, TV of present day and so on). We can hear the latest words most easily in the TV programs, because it reflects the trend in society. While we watch the TV programs, you should try to write down popular expressions, and you could learn to make proper use of honorific expressions, the language of young people or daily language usage. There are other ways of doing this exercise. At first, it is reading newspaper (for New York Times and Los angels Times and so forth.) This is not for listening practice but for reading it. At the same time, we can learn the latest languages from sentences. Next, it is using Internet. We can get more recent informations from languages, and it fed information into a computer. What's more the computer is capable of storing millions of pieces of it, so whenever we want to know it, we can pull it out. It is your continual efforts that lead you to success. That is why we need to be careful about our home environment. That is to say, Japanese has a register, so does English. They tend to overlook this point, but it is an important field to make out people of different countries .
Second, we should make use of e-mail more and more, and you are able to make friends over the entire world. If you make a friend in different countries, you can exchange opinions with them. For example, common habits and their school life within the same generations and so on. Whether you want to make e-mail friends, you had better connected the site of making friends. This will lead us difference of how to use register between English and Japanese . "Phatic communion" and "small talk" are clearly different things within the same generations. It is important that we learn the way of speaking from our heart .
The last point is that we had better study implication of languages, because we can find out different styles of each country. It is difficult to understand this, and maybe it is the largest subject what we learn other countries thorough English .
We often tend to overlook these ideas, but this is essential for international society, and it is an important part in relationships. That is to say we have to study the latest words, and we should understand different countries, cultures and temperament. The truth is that, we are surrounded by a lot of opportunity of learning English, but we missed them, so we must be careful watch them .
