Title: Death Penalty 
 
I am basically against the death penalty because I think that a man has not the right to judge other persons. If the right to judge criminals exist, only the victims has it. Only the victims know ache that criminals gave them, but not judges in court. I just disagree the idea that other human beings have power to judge life or death of criminals, human beings .
It's natural that the victim's family, friends, and colleages have sorrow and want to kill criminals. I will feel the same way if one of my family is killed. But is the criminal bad really? They may have a good life before they do awful crime. I don't think any people are bad from the beginning. They sometimes commit crime emotionally without thinking about it much. Or they just lost all their hope and wanted to act badly. Sometimes the difference between criminals and ordinaly people is small. Then what has made the criminals bad? It may be the criminal's family, friends or social surroundings. I believe that a criminal is not a criminal by nature. Whatever the factor that has the criminals bad is, the responsibility lies in both the criminals and those factors. I mean we have to consider those factors that made criminals bad, because even if the criminals died by death penalty, other criminals will do the same thing if we don't try to solve the problem from the bottom .
I think it is unreasonable that only the criminals are blamed, the factor that has made the criminals bad should be also accused of the responsibility. If individuals care more about their social surroundings, the crimes will be decrease. It can be said to young people's crimes most. Now people talk about carrying out death penalty to young criminals. But some young people are neglected or treated badly by parents, thus influenced by bad friends or situations and commit crime. Some of them killed people without knowing its meaning .
So I don't want to blame only them. I think our social sorroundings based on our own families are more important to make a person good or bad, so the parents has a responsibility of their own children's grow. We have to know this fact, and make efforts to keep good social surroundings. To kill criminals don't solve the problem .
Death penalty can solve nothing. Crimes happen if the society is the same, so we should solve the bad points of the society that are making criminals first. The criminals should be given a chance to reform himself. And the society's long support is necessary for the criminals. It's more human to help criminals to become good, than finish everything by death. As I said before, I don't approve humans kill other human. Actually, some examples of misjudges exist. And such "eye for eye" approach is not progrresive .
