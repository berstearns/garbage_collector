Title: Capital Punishment 
 
There are constant controversies concerning capital punishment. The problem is whether capital punishment is necessary, whether capital punishment has the deterrence, whether the condemned criminal's rights should be respected, whether capital punishment rewards the victims and their family. On the other hand, the another problem is whether there is any substitute of capital punishment, whether there are the risk of increasing the crimes if capital punishment abolished. I stand on the necessity theory of capital punishment as follows .
First, it is needed to respect the victims and their families. Shigematu (1995) states that the recent trial sometimes sympathize with the suspects and treat victims coolly. Indeed, the sorrow and injury which the victim and their family accepted should not disappear. But capital punishment is the one of the way to lighten these feelings .
Second, capital punishment is needed to keep the social order. According to the public opinion poll in 1994, the public opinion supported the acceptation of capital punishment at the highest figure ever. Shigematu (1995) thinks this data indicates that people have healthy sensitivities to defend the heinous crimes. It means that capital punishment has dterrence. If there is no capital punishment system, what can deter heinous crimes. He insists the existence value of capital punishment system. If there are no crimes, the existence of capital punishment is the intelligence, view and respect of human. It means that capital punishment justifies the human moral. However, capital punishment should not be decided easily in any cases. He admits the risk of capital punishment that if the judgment and step is wrong, misjudgment will happen and people who really did not commit crimes may be punished. So capital punishment should be decided after the strict trial and should not be misjudged absolutely .
In Japan, the abolition theory seems very popular now. We can see many articles which state the abolition of capital punishment. The abolitionist is superior to the people who insist the necessity. However, as Shigematu says, the real crimes should not be taken only by whitewash. To support the necessity of capital punishment, we can refer to American debates about it. Gorecki (1983) indicated that the sudden change of the general sentiment has occurred after the abolitionist trend in America. The abolitionist sentiment reached its peak in 1996, but it has undergone a steep decline since then. He proceed from the decay of the criminal justice system to the growth of crime, to the anger and fear, and eventually, to decline of the abolitionist sentiment as the most immediate determinant of the legal reversal under discussion. The growth of crime has been shocking in recent decades .
Recently, in Japan, too, the heinous crimes like America are increasing. We also have the anger and fear indicated in the public poll in 1994. I stand on the necessity of capital punishment because like America, we need this system to put down these public feelings. Then, as Shigematu(1995) says the existence of capital punishment with the strict and right judgment, under the independent administration, justify human moral .
