Title: Death Penalty 
 
The number of countries which abolish the death penalty has been increasing. The United Nations General Assembly also adopted "The Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty" in 1989 and published it in 1991. Contrary to these world movement, in most of America, China and Japan, the death penalty remains. By the opinion poll held in 1994, over 70% of Japanese people agreed to the death penalty .
Executions go unpublicized. Families of executed criminals Are notified only after the dead, so they can claim the bodies if they wish. The condemned person does not know when or if the execution will take place. I think this practice is both unusual and unnecessarily cruel .
But most of Japanese people don't know such cruel practice. Because the executions go unpublicized. The government has long claimed that executions are implemented in secret out of consideration for the feeling of the families, even of the condemned person themselves .
But I don't think that it's good for the families and condemned persons who prefer dying without being know? Most of man may want people around him to grieve when he die .
The practice that executions are implemented in secret is not for the families and the condemned persons themselves. More likely, the practice merely serves the interests of the state by suppressing public knowledge of this potentially contentious issue .
The lobby against the death penalty is weak in Japan. Under the present circumstances, it is difficult to tell in Japan or merely a logical consequence of the government induced secrecy surrounding capital punishment. The opinion that "Out of sight, out of mind2 is not good .
But Mr, Nakamura Shozaburo said recently that the government was considering the announcement of execution in advance . "We believe the public should know about executions that are carried out in accordance with court decisions," he told reporters. But he didn't say anything about notifying the prisoners themselves. It's a small opening, but it's very significant. Because it is the first time the government has considered modifying its policies on capital punishment .
Actually, the movement has been promoting. For example, the sentences seem to be reserved only for those convicted of the most heinous offenses. I hope such movement promote more and more .
Oneday morning, I watched a certain TV program. The theme was the death penalty. And a man whose brother was kill appeared. His brother was insured and killed by the beneficiary. The defendant was sentenced the death penalty. But he reflected after that and had written letters for the family for 3 years He apologized. The family, of course didn't forgive, but they demanded for the court to cancel the death penalty. But it didn't come true. And the executions went unpublicized .
The performer said "The criminal died, but my brother never revive. We are not healed at all. The death penalty only make sorrow."
As he said, I think death penalty only make negative things. So I against the death penalty. Nobody has right to kill others. Even if it's government or court .
