Title: Capital Punishment 
 
Today, there are many arguments with the capital punishment. Because criminals become more merciless, it is hard for us to forgive their crimes. Some people say that criminals kill one or two people, they of course should be killed. I also can't forgive them. But I think the capital punishment (death penalty) must be abolished. I have three clear reasons against the capital punishment .
The first, there are a lot of risk of false accusation. It is true that miss judgements are decreased nowadays but, even now, there are many illegalities or injustice of prosecutor and police. It is impossible to say there are not any miss judgement. A judge is also a person. He can not be perfect. We can't say he is perfect. There is an objection that if death penalty must be abolished on the ground of the importance of the miss judgement, the penal servitude also must be abolished. by some reason. People who have this objection think death penalty shouldn't be abolished by the reason of the risk of false accusation. But death penalty is completely different from penal servitude Innocent criminal must die cursing this world, but if his ca live, he can do anything he want to do even if he has become eighty years old after the liberation .
The second, I want to explain by objecting people who say death penalty has deterrent power of crime. Actually there are many opponents who maintain death penalty saying this reason, but there is no person who committed the crime thinking he would be executed for the crime. In this case, death penalty don't have power to stop criminal from killing people And, In the countries which have already abolished the death penalty, there are not any reports that the abolishment cause any other negative results. So I think The death penalty can't be the deterrent power of crimes .
I would like to develop the last reason by objecting people who insist on the rationality of the death penalty talking about the emotion of the victim's family. Taking account of the big grief of the victim's family, it is understandable that they hope the criminal's death. Many opponents of capital punish ment say that without the criminals' death, the survivor can't be salveged from the big sorrow. But it is wrong. Every state shouldn't allow them to revenge for the criminal. To make the death of the criminal the means of the consolation is the superficial solution. In the first place, the grief of the victim's family can't be consoled by revenge. Rather they can get peace of mind by forgiving the criminal. The victim's family can't be consoled by the death of the criminal. It is clear that even if the criminal die, the victim will never return. The brank of the family's mind will be never filled. People don't want to be said "Your enemy who killed your son were killed. So you should be happy and live not having anything wrong." And, though the victim's family hate only the criminal, the society around the criminal should take responsibility of the crime, too. It is wrong to e only the criminal .
By these three reasons, I object the rationality of the capital punishment. It is true that most nation hope the continuance of the death penalty, but in the first place, this issue is just the right of minolity, the delicate and important point. So we shouldn't confuse democracy and public opinion This issue is out of the democratic system. Every government must take the position that any murder can't be permitted. By any reason, people mustn't kill other people. The politicians who have big power should offer adequate and accurate information and guide the public opinion to the right direction .
