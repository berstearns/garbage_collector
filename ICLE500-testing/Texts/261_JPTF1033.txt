Title: Death Penalty 
 
In Japan, the death penalty is decided to be the ultimate punishment to brutal crimes. However, I am opposed to the death penalty. Some people would say that criminals, who murdered other people, should be punished by very harsh way, or be put to death. But I don't think we are allowed to derive people's lives, even if the authority admits it .
Firstly, we cannot say that the death penalty decreases the number of crimes. For instance, there was a fiendish case of murder in which some elementary school children were stabbed and killed by a man with a knife in Osaka prefecture. In the case, the offender said he intended to die after he had committed the crime. In this way, some criminals are ready to be put to death from the first. Therefore, even if we try to stop brutal crimes, to the contrary, the death penalty is used as a reason to commit a crime. We cannot say the death penalty scares people and prevents the next crime from occurring. It is not useful, nor effective .
Secondly, people usually think that the death penalty is the hardest thing for criminals. However, I believe that there are things that are very tough for them to endure. For example, think of returning to the society after they finish a term of sentence. People around them maybe behave more coolly than before, and also they won't try to contact with the ex-criminals positively. It is, I think, because people are afraid if the ex-criminals would do the same thing again or they would hurt the neighbors as they did before. Which results in the ex-criminals' isolation from the society. I think it is harder for them than being put to death. What is really hard is being isolated, being mentally damaged. Consequently, I don't believe that the death penalty is necessary to suffer the criminals .
Finally, the death penalty doesn't always make the victim's family satisfied. When we give a thought to the victim's family, we take it for granted that the family wants the death penalty to revenge the offender. Nevertheless, it is not always true. I once watched a TV program, in which a man whose brother had been killed several years before, at first strongly wanted the murder to die. However, after having thought thoroughly, he concluded that the death penalty wasn't necessary for the murder and even for him. Because if the murder would be killed, the case of his brother would come to an end, and people in the society would forget about his killed brother. Furthermore, the fact that he was suffered from the case would also be forgot forever. At this point, if we really think of left families, the death penalty can't be the solution .
In conclusion, the death penalty cannot be the means to stop brutal crimes or satisfy the victim's family. Moreover, we should not be able to judge whether a person lives or dies, even though the country backs us up. In the future, there will be various crimes and the number of them may even increase. Nonetheless, we should choose the alternative that gives us not the right to kill criminals but the wisdom to help them start their lives afresh. We should make much of a person's life in any situation. For these reasons, I disagree with the death penalty .
