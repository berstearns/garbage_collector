Title: Death Penalty 
 
Should the death penalty be maintained? For many years, this question has been argued about all over the world. Though recently, opinions about the death penalty in the world are moving toward abolishing it, Japan still continues to execute it. In my opinion, the death penalty should be abolished. The death penalty seems to be the easiest and the permanent solution for the criminal problems, but it is no more than to erase all. Even if it eases the victim's family for a while, it doesn't make any profit. There are some reasons why the death penalty doesn't make sense .
First, the death penalty doesn't have the effect of restraining latest criminals from killing people. People who believe in having the death penalty say that it will make people think twice before committing a crime and that it is useful for the deterrent of a felony. In fact, however, the murder rate has actually gone up instead of down in the past 23 years since execution has become legal. When a murderer commits a crime, he or she must be too excited to think twice or they can't kill people!
Secondly, the death penalty is not necessarily being the hardest punishment for murderers. People who are in favor of the death penalty insist that murderers should be punished by the hardest penalty. In this competitive time, however, many people kill themselves to escape form life's hardships, so death penalty can be, for some murderers, means of escape. Ending the life of the victim also means ending of feeling remorse for his crime. I think murderers must pay for their actions by thinking a great deal of what they did and suffering much remorse, not by being executed .
Thirdly, the death penalty only makes nothing but another sorrow. The life of the victim never be able to be back again even if the hateful murderer is also be killed. It only makes another body die. Let's not forget that the philosophy of "an eye for an eye." only makes another blindness after all .
Finally, there is a possibility of courts passing a false sentence. Innocent people have been and will be convicted and condemned to death as long as the death penalty exists. And of course, if never be able to be reversed once it is completed even if it reveals that the conviction is false. The possibility may be so small compared to the number of passing a correct sentence, but there surely is. Can you imagine what it feels like for families of criminals who are condemned to death on a false charge? Even if the possibility is much less than 0.000001%, as long as it exists, the death penalty shouldn't be maintained .
However, there is a problem if the death penalty is abolished. There is a system of parole and life imprisonment in Japan, that means a murderer could be free someday and commit another murder if there was not the death penalty. In that case, the family and friends of the victim won't be relieved forever. Thus, I propose abolishing those two systems as well as the death penalty. This is the conclusion I thought that would be thest, all things considered .
