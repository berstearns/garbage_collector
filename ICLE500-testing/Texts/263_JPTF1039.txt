Title: Death Penalty 
 
On July the nineteenth, we had a discussion which is about death penalty. In the discussion, I was a supporter of death penalty. After hearing each person's opinion, though, my feeling didn't change at all. From this discussion, I learned how difficult to talk about a issue in English. And I will to try to explain what I thought to improve our discussion in the following section. And after that, I would like to show my position and show some reasons .
First, we have to deside more detailed things about the share before the discussion. If we didn't make it in the advance, a small confusion is sometimes supported to occur. To put the member in each role of saying useful statement in the discussion means good teamwork, which leads to better discussion .
Second, to know about the issue is necessary. Persons in the group have each sense of values, which often is influenced by his or her surroundings. So we need to know concrete information in the advance of the discussion. Gathering much info is ideal. And a lot of useful datum can be a good tool to support our opinion .
The last important point is that we should join the discussion more aggressively. If your colleague in need, you should jamp in to support his or her suggestion any time during the discussion. If it is possible, everyday should enjoy their discussion like this. To enjoy the discussion, we at first enjoy speaking English anyway. Feeling that it's not special to talk in English is really good for us, English learner. And It's our essential personal homework for everyday, I think .
On this day, I though over these things, especially the last point, to enjoy speaking English is my next goal of English study. I learned so many English words, easy to difficult, which was washed away after the entrance exam was over. Pathtic. I even now forgetting some words, perhaps. To cope with these problems, we should be always curious about the everything around the English. English TV, radio English program, and so forth. Approaching oneself to English world makes you more interested English speaking .
And this following phase, I am going to explain why I support death penalty. The most important reason is that the person do not have the right to argue his own right to live like normal person. And given such a penalty, a criminal would be checked by us. Thinking another way to do with criminal, there is a life sentence. Some people syas that what the difference of "death penalty" and "life sentence." Absolutely there is, I think. The person who committed a murder or like that should take on the responsibility. Its responsibility is quite equal to death penalty .
I suppose most people who is against death penalty say this, judgement's dangerous to be a false charge. If we have to do away with a thing which can kill a person by mistake, then we need to do away with car, (there are so many car accidents since it was made by human being.) pistol, (But so many pistols are in America and many countries all over the world.) So it is not right to talk about the possibility of killing a accused person by false charge. That is why I support death penalty more than life sentence .
