Title: Death Penalty 
 
In my point of view, we should not abolish the death penalty in Japan, though other countries abolish it. It seems to take an important role in restricting the crime. Without this system, criminals will feel too easy for committing crime. The number of criminals killed are very small, but the existence of the death penalty itself has the power to stop crimes. Our world do not consist of only good humans, so we absolutely need heavy punishment to keep the society safe .
First of all, the death penalty not only stop future crime but also decreases the degree of the crime. Potential criminals will hesitate and reconsider the actions they're going to take, when they are reminded of the existence of the death penalty. Recently I heard that young criminals commit crime because they knew they won't have heavy punishment because they are under legal age. It means if they know it before, some of them won't take action. So, the existence of the death penalty itself is effective to change the thoughts of criminals .
Another reason is that I've heard some criminals repeat crimes after leaving prison. Such people seem not to be able to reform themselves after a long years in prison. Therefore, it might not be wrong that criminals who repeat crimes over and over will get the death penalty. Because putting them in prison doesn't bring good result, and our tax money is used to keep them in prison. Unfortunately, there are some criminals who can't become good though our or society's help. Of course, some criminals can or want to reform themselves and compensate for their crimes, but I think the death penalty will be also effective to prevent their another crime. If they become good, we shouldn't discriminate them. But the existence of the death penalty can protect them by giving them additional warning .
Some people say that the death penalty is cruel and inhuman. But it's just a penalty or punishment and it is criminals that are cruel and inhuman. If we think about the case of Ikeda Elementary School that a criminal killed many children for no reason, I'm sure we all want to feel like killing him. Bad and cruel crimes are increasing and our society is becoming more and more dangerous. Worst crimes can't avoid the death penalty because lighter punishment won't satisfy both victims' family and general public. If I am victim's family, my soul doesn't recover by long imprisonment of the criminal (and actually, we don't have lifetime imprisonment in Japan). And the crime like Ikeda Elementary School is just unforgivable. We need a very heavy punishment, the death penalty to be equal to the worst crime .
In crimes, there are various cases and degrees, so it is reasonable that various penalties are applied according to how the crime is committed. If we have light punishment for light crimes, we should have heavy punishment for the worst one. The theory seems very natural to me. Therefore, the critical penalty is needed to make the system complete .
