Title: Death Penalty 
 
I am in support of the death penalty. I'll state three reasons why I assent to the death penalty .
First, it'll help to reduce vicious crimes because of the dread of death. We couldn't understand how fearful the person who is passed a sentence of death. It might be very cruelty that you don't know when the end comes to. However, I think it cannot helped abolishing the death penalty . "The law of death penalty is very cruelty, so that we have to abolish it." Isn't be a fair cause. What offender did deserve ill of. The appropriate punishment for such a serious offence is the death penalty .
Secondly, there are some doubt whether the families' wound be heated without the death penalty. It might be extreme grief for rest of families. They might need the treatment of mental health disorders. Their rest of life might be full of tragedy .
If their sorrows and anger become larger and larger, they will not control their promotion. It might raise up next crime. In addition to this, A person who commit a crime betray and hurt his friends and family doesn't deserve compassion. Regrettably, in the present state of affairs, the Ministry of Justice fear losing it's prestige rather than emotion of survivers .
Finally, the death penalty is very suitable and natural disfavor for the evil offenders. In this world, there are many offenders who can't help returning society and we don't permit like that person let a lone in the society. And in addition to this, the taxes should not be used for them. If they are in first chance to back to the society, we have to back up, but some cases are different. There are some offender who repeat same mistake. We have to use that money for different thing, like institution for the elderly person and the disabled, or changing education system. For example, Juvenile crimes are getting more heinous and are increasingly committed by groups rather than individual. Out of the total cases of murder and attempeted murder by youths tried in criminal courts over the last 10 years, 85% involved the use of weapons. We have to think about their future more stressly, and use money for them .
In these days, vicious crime is increasing. The world, even in safety Japan, the number of evil accident grows. The death penalty is the very lows we need to control our dangerous future of society. Specially saying about Japanese low system, there is no life imprisonment. The term in prison finish only 10 years. It's unfair .
Conclution, I think the death penalty need for some cases, and we don't have to abolish it .
