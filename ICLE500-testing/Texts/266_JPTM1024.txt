Title: Death Penalty 
 
We still have death penalty in Japan. I don't think no one in the world have a right to decide to kill anyone. I'm against the idea of death penalty .
I watched a TV program reporting death penalty in the world. There are quite a few countries where they still have death penalty. I wonder why people can decide to kill any other people. It's just like a war. The scenes on the TV report were very miserable and I'd like to write my opinion against death penalty in this essay .
First reason against the death penalty is that usually in the countries where they still have death penalty, the justice system is not arranged correctly. The government in those countries usually has a leader like Hitler. The people in the high position in those countries can decide whether the person in judge should reserve death penalty or not. Because of the poor govermental system, we can say they still have death penalty .
Secondly, death penalty does not lesson the number of crimes in that country. One of the purpose of death penalty is to show other people that if you do something wrong and something against the government, you'll be killed. Is there any country where they have less crimes because of having death penalty? I don't think so. Death penalty only give fear to people in the country. There is no effect of lesson the number of crimes .
Thirdly, how can you give death to a person who had crime? Do you think you can kill the person by your hand? In some countries, electric chair is used. However, there is no difference. Think that you push the button of the chair. How can you do that? What would you think if the judge was not right. Can you make the dead alive? Never. Thus, I think putting in jail for life is much better than death penalty .
Fourthly, the criminal may have a chance to follow a normal life. If he had a chance to think, to apologize, to plan ahead, he may be able to go back to the society later. Can we take his change away? In case of homicides, of course we can understand how the family of the killed feel. They are eager to kill the criminal, I'm sure. Still some of the family members sometimes want the criminals come back to the society so that they can work for the other people. That actually happens. The TV program showed how a person who was supposed to sentenced to death relived from it and have a social life. He worked hard in jail and apologized to the family of the killed and the family forge him. Thus, there is a way for the criminal to come back to the society. If you think people's life important, then you need to forgive the criminals, too .
Lastly, I think we are all humans. I wonder how we can decide to kill some one on the earth. We don't have the right to do so. Of course the same thing can be said from the family of the killed. We need to ask them to be patient and kind. By forgiving even the criminals, we can really live together on the mother earth .
