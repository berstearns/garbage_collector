Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
	There are many common things between mass media and religion. Mainly they both have addictive power on people, ability of binding people in one very intimate, and close group, however the most powerful influence they have is their controlling power. Their one word will affect on millions of people in every aspects, for example their life path, decision, life style, morality recklessly. So, where are the power is coming from? The power is coming from the fear of not being a part of the group, being a outcast, and being responsible fully for their action, and decisions. Therefore believing religion, and mass media can be seen as imputation of responsibility, reflection of human's major fear of loneliness, and the most effective way to control thousands of million of people. In this regards we can say mass media is new 20 century's religion .
	First, once mother Teressa said, [Quotation] . One of the most fatal reasons of human's death from ancient time to modern society is the depression coming from the loneliness. So hundreds decades ago, the easiest way to gather people in one group, and let them forget about the fact that we are all alone would be creating what people now call "religion". Likewise, these days if you don't watch TV, or read newspapers you can't really be part of the conversation with people. so now you ought to keep in touch with all kinds of mass media, to keep with people, and not to be a loner or a outcast .
	Second, religion and mass media are the most effective mechanism when it comes to control the people's behaviour. For example, people who believe in the bible, try their best not to go against what the book say. Rather than following their instinct, they go along with the path what the bible made. In this manner, if a magazine says that one certain fashion style will be a trend of this year, it will affect on millions of people's consuming tendency for the year. We are living in the era where one celebrity or news broadcaster's word can shake the coutry or whole world like Jesus did thousand years ago .
	Third, religion and mass media are the best things that we can impute our responsibilities, and sins. These days, most of new informations and ideas come from mass media which mean whatever we decide or think is mostly coming from mass media, so if something goes wrong because of my poor judgement or decision, we can alway blame media. Likewise, for example, in the middle age, people created a crusade war with, god's name. They justified their cruel murder with they god's name .
	In conclusion, religion, and media have so many similar aspects. They bond people into a group and give them an illusion that they are not alone, and they have enormous power on people, when it comes to control them, and brain-washing them, at last they also become excuses for human's poor behaviour. So basically, we can't live without them, but on the other hand, we shouldn't depend on them fully.
