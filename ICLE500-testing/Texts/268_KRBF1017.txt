	Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination what is your opinion?
	We are living in a society which has TVs understanding human's orders and robots made for military. So it is true that science's remarkable development made this world. About these technology and industrialisation, some people say it destroyed places to dream and imagine. Although some people think there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination, I think technology and industiralisation make people be creative .
	First of all, scientific technology and industrialisation broke the occupations into parts so that more artists could think more creative. In the president, there are so many detail jobs that common people even cannot recognize them. And those subdivided vocations make the workers think more creative. For example, In past there were not various painter. They all used same dyestuffs and canvasses. However, artists' tools are very various like : sand, water, clothes, phones, TVs and etcetera. As the jobs are going to be more detailed, workers have to think in detail too. And "in detail" means "more creative". For instance, cartoonists in the past just draw the characters in line because their serial stories were published by books but now, cartoonists publish their works on the website. So they attach some photos and book ground musics to their comics. It let the writers think more creative and original when they draw the cartoons .
	Second, magnificent development of technology and industrialization provide people to experience more vivid world. Recently, many movies are put on the screen in 3D. Moreover several movies screen only in 3D. Furthermore, There are 4D theater. At there, people can watch a 3D movie sitting at chairs which vibrate during the action scene. Also water, wind, snow, even bubbles are coming out from the behind of the chair! Children's toys are developed to make them creative, too. For instance, There is a 3D carpet forming football ground, farm, village and so on. Children can see feel those places on the carpet in the house. They do not need to find pictures in books or internet. How do you think about this? What do you think it is more creative? Normal movie or 4D movie?, Normal carpet or 3D carpet?
	In conclusion, I believe that industiralisation and technology make more detailed occupations and it also makes the employees to think more unique and creative in the result. And products of science techonology make it more easily. Also technology and industrialisation provide places and equipment which people feel the world they neve have seen before . 4D movies take watchers to the sky, space and sea in a minute and more three-dimensional supplies for baby and children let them experience other world vividly. So I think it is non-arguable that the development of technology brings us to the place we can dream and imagine.
