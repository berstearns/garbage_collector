Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
	From 19th century feminism is becoming more and more popular as a tool for women to be freedom and equal on every aspect. We all know that women had very little rights and their social status was also lower than men before. So many feminists or organizations for women appeared to help women to get rights and improve their social status. However, nowadays there are more about whether feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good or not. Some people hold on their opinions that feminists have done more good to the cause of women than bad because feminists work for women and have achieved succeed in some aspects. However, I think feminists have done more to the cause of women than good because they receive much stress than before on several aspects .
	First of all, on the aspect family, feminists have help women improve their status, but they feel stressful with their families. With the encourage of feminists women can go out from their home to get a job, and they get rid of the household jobs. However, problems also occur followed with freedom. They begin to busy with their jobs and have no or little time to accompany with their children and husbands. They want to show themselves they are also very outstanding as men so they should work much harder than men. Their children begin rely on their fathers and women will feel lonely because their jobs estrange them from families. Furthermore, they can not stay at home everyday to enjoy life no longer because have to work. Women feel much stressful with their families .
	Secondly, on the aspect of politics, women get much more right than before which means that they also receive stress from it. Even though women's political status is improved, they should also do much things for politics or society. Many women devote themselves to politics, for example, they want to work at political office and are active at winning one election. There was no worries for women about how to win one election and how to use their rights correctly before, but now they have to worry about these things because feminists have made them own such rights. Furthermore, if they can not use their rights correctly their people will endure much painess. For such reasons women are more stressful than before .
	Finally, women are very stressful on the aspect of family economy. Feminists have have women to be equal in their families so that they should also work to earn half of their family spend as men do. We all know that women and men have much difference in physical aspect,. But now women should do the same things as men, so women will feel stressful. However, before feminists work for women to get rights and to be equal with men, there is no necessary for women to worry about how to earn money for their families and work out everyday. For this family economy women are stressful .
	In conclusion, even though feminist have help women and they are behalf women, one the contrary, they are much more stressful than before on several aspects. So I hold the opinion that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
