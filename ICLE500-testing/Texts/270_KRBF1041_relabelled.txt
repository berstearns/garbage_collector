Title:  Should children unconditionally obey their parents?
 
	Obeying your parents' words is regarded as one of the etiquettes in Korea. From Korean tradition, this has become an very important norm to sustain Korean society. In reality, parents often intervene in the behavioral mode of their children as well as in choosing their clothes or even their spouse. Hence, between children and parents, they don't sometimes see eye to eye, and end up staying in a conflict. However, children should avoid conforming unconditionally to what their parents instruct them now that one-sided obedience could hamper developing their spontaneity. First of all, a number of the young in Korea seem to show the disposition that they have difficulties in doing things themselves. Despite some simple matters, they don't get a sense what they have to do or even what they want to. That's because they have been raised in a way which their parents decide almost everything about what their children should do. For example, during the summer and winter vacation, some Korean parents are busy doing their children's assignments so that they can get a good score. Under the circumstances where children cannot follow their thoughts, they could get accustomed to the situation in which they accept their parents' suggestions. Therefore, they might try to neither come up with their own thoughts about the matter nor think the suggestions given by their parents over whether they are proper to be carried out. Second of all, it appears that the young in Korea are such passive persons that they don't express themselves as well as those of western countries do. Take German students, who are willing to speak their opinions in the class, they learn, when young, that they have to take responsibility for their behavior and decision from their parents and the system of Germany. Germans are allowed to drink much earlier than in other countries. It holds true in choosing the academic course, too. Unlike other countries, German students have to choose to advance to either general schools or vocational schools at the age of 10 to 12. From this point of view, it's worth taking account into that passive attitude of the students may have stemmed from the lopsided obedience rooted in the Korean society. Perhaps passive attitude are likely to lead the young to be less competitive in the international society because giving good presentations accounts for much of your ability in the business today. All things considered, it fears that children could not break through hardship they might face in the future by themselves only if they do not behave spontaneously. So, children in Korea should be encouraged to think and decide themselves rather than to follow their parents' words all the time. Besides, thinking and making a decision themselves are quite important not only in learning how to socialize, but in establishing the framework of being a grown-up. I don't want to say that obeying parents isn't necessary at the moment, but in case of Korea, children have to make an effort to be independent from their parents.
