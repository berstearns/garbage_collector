Title: Should children unconditionally obey their parents?
 
	All parents in Korea want their children to have successful life. Thus they always worry about them and think about how to help even though they may spend their whole lives for their children. One of the common ways they do is to interfere in children's life through giving them advices or making a decision instead of them. And then they ask their children to accept and follow theirs. What do you think about that children always have to fulfill those things? In my opinion, they do not need to do that. It is hard for sons and daughters to get results as much as parents want and they will not take fewer advantages of it than they expect. They just make children lose their identities and reduce the ability of decide. For this reason, I would like to talk about Korean children ' independence, and their ability to overcome troubles. First, children will forget about themselves as they are following their parents' idea with no reasons. These days, most of the families have just one child or two children and my uncle and aunt have only one son like other families. They do everything for him not only to avoid the difficulties but also not to be in troubles; teaching English, piano and fencing and so on before he realizes what he really wants to learn and buying him many kinds of toys although he did not say what he wants. As a result, he has never had enough chances to think about himself, and then he can not easily answer when I ask which subjects, color, fruits or games he likes. In other words, he doesn't know well who he is. Because of that, sometimes he acts arrogantly as a prince. Second, children having parent who always makes decision instead of them do not know what they have to consider for their determination when they face difficulties. And they are confused what is more important in given situation because they have never practised to choose of the many things. Thus it is not easy for them to develop their lives by themselves through great choices. For instance, I had never been against my parent until the graduation of high school, That is I regarded their opinions and decision as the best things for my life and I took them whenever they gave me. However, I was embarrassed when I had problems to solve by myself during my university life. In conclusion, children in Korea do not always need to obey their mother and father. Forcing to follow parents' with no proper consideration only let their sons and daughters not be aware of who they are. In addition, it remains their children as the young who can not determine which they truly are required for their lives. I believe that children should be independent in the future even though they are young. For this reason, Korean children have to set up their independence and develop abilities to deal with difficult problems in their lives.
