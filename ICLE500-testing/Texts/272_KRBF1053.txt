Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". 
 
	In these days, people think that the most important thing in the world is money. And this is also applied when they get a job. People want to work at a company that would be able to earn lots of money. However, I don't agree with that idea. The most important thing when we get a job is definitely not money. One of my friends is working in the Samsung. I have known him since I was 13 years gold. He used to say to me that he would be a social worker and help the people who were in the hard situation. However, he chose to be an officer worker instead of social worker. He said if he would be a social worker, he would always worry about his life because of the low salary of social workers. And he also said that I should think of my future carefully. I was able to understand what he chose and what he was saying. I just felt so sorry about him. A few months before, he told me that he was considering whether he would stop working or not. He said to me that he had a little difficulty working and felt stressful very much even though he was getting lots of money. Let's think of the possibility. If he chose to be a social worker he really wanted to be, could he have worked happily? What is the important thing living in this world worthy do you think? Money? Or the loyalty of your work? What else? What do you think? I have a friend who wants to be a teacher. Teacher is her dream since she was very young. She studied so hard to go to the university for teachers, and she was able to get a very good score at the test. But after the result of the test had arrived, her parents wanted her to go to the law school. Because that's enough scores to go to the law school so her parents thought if she went there, it would be helpful to her life. They tried to persuade her to go to the law school, but she did not give up her dream. At last, she went to the university she wanted and she said to me that she would never regret her choice. I was very impressed. As you know, if she went to the law school and would be a lawyer, she must have earned lots of money and been able to get a great loyalty in her life. However, why did she not go? Maybe she has something more valuable than money in her life. If so, what is that? We must remember that money does not make us happy. Money is not the way to be happy. Even if you are earning lots of money, we could not say that you are success in life. Whatever we choose, we should not be shaken in our belief cause of money. I hope you realize what is the best thing in your life soon.
