Title: Should children unconditionally obey their parents?
 
	Many Korean parents believe their children ought to be rather submissive and obedient. With plenty of their life experiences and ability to make more considerate decisions, the parents often try to convey their children a lot of useful advice that they need to learn for better life. Indeed, no parents want their children to commit the same kind of mistake that they have already done before. So the kind of lessons parents give their children are believed to be educational and constructive. However, it may not be helpful to their children at all when parents almost always try to force them to follow their ready-made rules and ideas all the time while children growing up because it can cause several problems. First of all, parents can destroy the opportunity their children can develop and establish their own philosophy of life if parents direct their children what to think and how to behave all the time. Since every individual is born to have his/her own unique opinions and perspectives, the kind of thoughts parents have cannot be identical with that their children have. For example, if your parents believe that it is honorable for you, as a woman, to get married to a rich family and live the rest of your life serving your husband and taking care of your children until you are dead, and if they force you to follow the advice, they are actually manipulating and destroying your whole life regardless of your expectations, which is opposite to your parents' wishes. Maybe you don't want to even get married. You want to run a business or travel the world. Thus, parents advice does not always work well for their children because each of their way of thinking is different. Secondly, another reason why children don't have to always take their parents' advice is that what parents' tell you to do can be sometimes misleading. For example, some parents tell their child that he may well dodge his mandatory military service by illegal manner. In this case following parents' advice does not seem to be desirable at all. At worst, the child might have to serve in prison and live with the criminal records. As for another example, other parents may think that it is not good for their child to study with physically-challenged students in the same school even though there are no any solid evidence for that. In that circumstances, the parents want their child to transfer to another school where only normal students attend. It may cause the child to imprint a discriminatory views on physically challenged persons as they have learned from their parents. As you can see, not all parents give appropriate messages that their children need to learn. Indeed, frequently, in our society, some parents give false education to their children. Finally, and most importantly, a child, when he grew up, may still depend on his parents' advice even when doing a very simple task only because it was his parents who have always been directing him what to do and he himself has learned to be obedient and respectable to them. This should bring forth a serious problem to the child. For example, consider a situation where the child are going on a blind date with his several friends. Since he is brainwashed to ask everything he does, he will automatically call his parents to ask some tips for his blind date. In his later life, he may keep asking his parents about his important matters such as marriage, his business, and, perhaps, even his children's education too. Hence, his parents' insistence that children should always listen to their advice will result in serious problems. In conclusion, even though in many respects parents' advice could be worthwhile in that the children get advice from them, it would give arise to many setbacks if the parents always decide what their children should do. Since every person has a right to create his own angle of looking at things, it may lead to bad results when parents make their children follow their way of living without having a slightest critical point of view. In addition, because parents' decisions or thoughts can be sometimes unjustice, it might be inappropriate for their children to take their parents' advice. Furthermore, when children became adult, they will always rely on seeking advice to their parents, as if a child, if they were educated to be always submissive and obedient to their parents. Therefore, children need to voice their own opinions, which may be unfavorable to their parents.
