Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
	In the 20th century, TV must be one of the most affective devices which human beings developed. I was also watching TV everyday, and now I'm watching TV as well. For this reason, some people named it as an "idiot box". When people watch TV, they do not think or talk with their friends or family numbers. Even though there are a lot of positive aspects of TV, this kind of negative aspects seems to make TV one of the useless devices instead of a marvellous invention. Moreover, some psychologists insist that watching TV is one of the causes to get down emotional quotient which is the scale of human feeling in terms of outside stimulation. In some sense, this is very reasonable, but I would like to point out positive aspects of TV in human life .
	First, TV plays an important role of entertainers. At the moment, other media such as movie, music, and DVD are also popular for this purpose, but TV is the most popular one in human life. For this reason, TV has become the closest friend among other media in low cost. Particularly, among people who do not have enough time to enjoy various entertainments, TV is quite convenient in this point of view. Furthermore, TV can provide a variety of genres of entertainment such as sports, comedy shows, and so on. For example, Sky, satellite TV channel, presents all kinds of movies and sports in the world for 24 hours. Even though this 24 hour channel would provoke some problems in the educational perspective, it seems to be true that TV is full of excitement. Another role of TV in terms of entertainment is to combine all people in the world. For instance, Euro 2004 Football Championships is one of the biggest sports game attracting all people even in different continents such as Asia, South America, or Africa. Through TV, they are able to enjoy the best football games. This is not a sports game, but a festival for the world. In this perspective, TV must be perfect medium to deliver human feelings .
	Second, TV has an economic role because the majority of people watch it everyday. In the economic perspective, TV is a good tool of advertisement. Comparing with other media, TV has the most audience, so the market of TV advertisement is bigger than others. Like this kind of example, TV occupies a significant part of world economy. Another example in the economic point of view is "TV Home Shopping" which is a shop in TV. Since there are not actual shops, the price of goods is very cheap. For example, "TV Home Shopping" is one of the fast growing businesses in Korea. Moreover, this TV shopping is related to other businesses such as home-delivery service. Although TV has various roles in human society positively, there are some problems such as some people are addicted to watch it for shopping for a long time. However, it seems to be impossible to get rid of TV because of this kind of side effect in my opinion .
	In conclusion, the nickname of TV, "idiot box", could be accurate indication in some aspects. At the moment, many people are watching TV without thoughts, and they are changing channels as well. In some sense, this aspect of TV may affect human beings negatively, and break out the worst side effect they don't know. I don't want to deny this point of view, but TV also has useful aspects such as entertainment and economy. The question of if Marx were alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television seems to point out one side of TV which has various sides in human life.
