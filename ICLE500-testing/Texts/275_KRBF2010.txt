Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
 Have you ever thought about dreaming and imaginating? everyone wants to be imaginating regardless of age, sex and state of life. However, they also think it is hard to reach to the imaginating and dreaming. because there is not a place of imagination and dreaming. it might be, but it might be but it is not for me .
 first of all, Justice of scientific technique and industrialization is important here. as first action scientific technique is a special skill or way of doing scientific. as second action industrialization is an industrialized country or area has a lot of industry . "How have scientific technique changed our lives?" The advancement of scientific technique brings a lot of in our lives. but Anybody may not deny using a word, 'scientific technique ' and ' industrialization ' in negative mean frequently, because the word 'scientific technique ' and ' industrialization ' contains meaning of literal-minded and not dreaming. and We can usually have seen the statistics that proves percentage of industrialization. so, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. some people agree to the statement in the topic. However, my opinion is strongly disagree with the opinion. there is many a place for dreaming and imagination. In my personal opinion, there is a place in the book. Although it can not be invisible to the naked eye. but it has an effect on people in many respects. The reasons are as in the following. we have gotten a experience and we also can get special experience that we could not experience directly. There are many books that have various story, so we can choose what we want to take on a role and various a world. For example, we can know the life of medieval people and how different they are with our modern life, if we choose the book about medieval life. as well as we can imagine. Maybe, most people like watching fruit of scientific technique TV rather than reading a book because it dominated by science technology and industrialization is easy to see screen of TV and we don't need to think what situation is. However, when we read a book, we can imagine. Suppose that we read "Harry potter" we can imagine the appearance of harry potter, his scar and his magic. For these two reasons above, book is a place for dreaming and imagination. as well as travel also can be a place of imagination. but travel is not place. but it is Abstract place . ' Travel more, you can see more'. travelling makes me fancy. people like traveling for many reasons. it is helpful for dreaming. above all things alone travel have been thinking about dreaming, so we have been dreaming about future. and we can many think time because the travel have used anologue more than a scientific technique. For example internet web surfing and cell phone using. scientific technique have double-sideness. therefore we should be aware double-sideness. If so, we are not dominated to the scientific technique . 
 By the book and travel, we can improve the imaginative power.
