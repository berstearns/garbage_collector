Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Feminism would aim to liberation of women. It starts for women who was restrained from the central force such as men and get rid of women species just pursuit equal human beings. but many events undergo and it's meaning varies gradually. Then it degenerate and bring side effects and confusion. So what are the reasons of feminism distort?
 Because first of all, Feminism misguides that women are fragile and inferior beings unconsciously. But the role of mother and wife is very important in society too. They form a family which is the foundation of society. However, in modern society, many people think that the housewife means the women who has nothing to do and the working mom means who has a capability. So women have obsession of perfect women. That cause depression and undergo hard married life extremely .
 Second, it fall from original purpose. Originally they want to get rid of women species and insist equality between men and women. It ignoreS the difference intrinsic attribute between men and women such as their culture or sexual trait. For example, men have a military duty in korea. But Israel women who are over eighteen has a military duty for two years because of religious faith. It looks equal. But in reality, women attribute little about military power because they are weaker than men by nature. In addition, according to some investigation, a quarter of women soldiers pregnant the period of service. So it really hard to mom and baby. Therefore military duty for women is unreasonable by any measure. it doesn't consider about different characteristic between men and women .
 Third, Feminism pursuit the result of equality superficially. It insists chance of equality between men and women originally. But it is distorted and makes distorted stereotyped image of women. So, it makes image of super women who has versatile person. for that reason, many modern women suffer from obsession of super mom image who are capable employee and good mother. So they have to take charge of the raising children and household problem. men works too. But they don't take charge of any other household. It starts from distorted feminism. and it follow the patriarchy that feminism exclude. It has a contradiction . 
 Third, someone misuse Feminism. For example, there is a menstrual leave. It's for women because their physiological trait. but it has a trouble with proof. someone misuse it. Hence, it rise reverse discrimination. Because men have to work more for woman who take menstrual leave. And other women are suspected of abuse. Hence, from the point of view of company, they prefer men to women. finally. Because the boss have to pay their women employee so employing men who don't have menstrual leave is more benefit. Finally, men and other women become victims . 
 But I think that women has a only inherent character like sight of delicacy or attitude of soft. So, we find and recognize those trait and develop them. Above all, meaning of Feminism have to rearrange. Not just for distorted women's rights but for equal human beings. Feminism have to go a appropriate purpose for respect of individual human beings .
