Title: Should the death penalty be mandatory for people that kill other people? 
 
 Whether capital punishment has to be abolished or not has been argued for a long time. In fact, No matter who it is, human don't have right to kill one's life. People made a law to exist social structure orderly from ancient society. Among that capital punishment is the highest penalty. However, since modern time, democracy emerging and dignity of human being becoming the most important ideology, argument about capital punishment has existed. In some ways, it is a system that works largely from the viewpoint of maintenance of society order and prevention of crime. But anybody doesn't have right to kill human. So group and nation as well as human do. Capital punishment is unjust and has to be scrapped due to these . 
 First, Human right to live is specified in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. No matter who it is, Human has God-given rights. Capital punishment is activity that infringes in human rights to live. Also, in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, anybody can't receive cruel, inhuman and insulting treatment or punishment. However, If executing a criminal, any government doesn't guarantee it. Capital punishment is cruel and inhuman punishment .
 Second, supporters of capital punishment says what it has effect about the prevention of crime, but it is groundless. Any study doesn't find relationship capital punishment between crime. Rather in Netherlands, as soon as they abolished capital punishment, heinous crime decreased. If the number of atrocious crimes are compared in the states in America with the death penalty system and the states that have abolished the system, atrocious crimes decreased in the states that abolished the system. In the Korea, however capital punishment exists, heinous crime like Yu Yeongcheol case occurs. That is, it isn't found that retention of capital punishment affects decrease of the crime rate . 
 Third, capital punishment refuses possibility that human can change. Without trying criminal to change, the capital sentence violates human rights. Condemn the offense and not its perpetrator. Actually, in study, majority of condemned criminal who commits heinous crime belong to the social vulnerable and don't have a happy childhood at all. In some ways, they are social victims. If due to effects of social environment they committed crime, on the other hand, due to effects of social environment they'll be enlightened. Human oneself has possibility of change. Because condemned criminal is also human, we have to acknowledge possibility if enlightenment and try to enlighten them . 
 Forth, If government executes death penalty, and it is turned out misjudgement, it'll be impossible to undo that. However A case seems to be clear and distinct, dangerousness of misjudgement surely exists. Actually, due to misjudgement, wrongful deaths has been. To prevent wrongful death of just one person, Capital punishment has to be abolished . 
 In conclusion, Nation commits murder against criminal by executing death penalty. Nation who protects dignity of ever human life must not be the subject of institutional murder. Also whether capital punishment is executed or not is the indicator of human rights which divide South Korea and North Korea. To criticize human rights problem like public execution of North Korea, We maintains leading superiority by not executing death penalty. Above of all, because capital punishment itself is against religious and humanistic value, it is a system that must disappear .
