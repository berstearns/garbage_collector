Title: Should the death penalty be mandatory for people that kill other people? 
 
Recently in Korea, a corpse of a 14 year-old girl was found in her neighborhood. Her body was raped, murdered, and left in a water tank on top of a building. The criminal was finally caught but no one could do anything to bring the pitiful girl back home. The legitimacy of the existence of the capital punishment is always debated after such a terrible incident. Although it is often asserted that death penalty should be vanished for the good of the humanity, I am an advocate of the capital punishment for it has more merits than demerits .
To begin with, people don't have the obligation to respect an individual who refuses to respect others. The most controversial aspect of the capital punishment is whether or not the death penalty infringes up on the rights of the human being. People question the validity of the legal "murder" of a human being by another. What I want to ask is this; do we need to respect the right of an individual who has, with full intent, destroyed the life of a vulnerable victim? I believe it is implied that when the criminal has decided to commit the terrible crime, one has decided to give up the right to be deserved as a respectful human being in our society. Thus, the capital punishment is absolutely legal to be in operation. When we examine the capital punishment, we should put more emphasis on the reason and the purpose of the act ?to discipline the criminal for the brutal crime? rather than focusing on the inevitable result ?death of an individual? of the operation .
One ironic fact also makes the operation of the death penalty plausible; the taxes paid by the family of the victim will be used for the imprisoned criminal if capital punishment is not available. Who could possibly imagine the grief and loss of the victim's loved ones? Their precious family member or friend will now have to be cherished only through photographs and memories. Using the taxes paid by these people for the imprisoned criminal is not only a financial waste for them but also a tremendous psychological pain. Also, the money paid by the normal citizens should be used to promote improvements in our society such as reconstructions of old buildings or social help for the needed. It shouldn't be frittered away on the things that are more of a waste than good, such as providing food, clothes, and medical care for the criminals that refused to live among the people as part of our society . 
On top of that, we can have the positive effect of lowering the crime rate with the existence of the capital punishment. It has been once reported that most of the major offenses are usually committed by the criminals who have already been imprisoned for a similar crime in the past. The murderer of the 14 year-old girl, mentioned in the first paragraph, was also an ex-convict who had served in jail for a similar sex offending charge before he committed the recent crime. By sentencing vicious, habitual criminals to death, we can prevent any possible occurrence of second-crimes by ex-convicts. Also, the existence of the penalty itself could bring alertness to potential criminals. Although some might insist long-time imprisonments, vicious criminals usually have psychological disorders, making it almost impossible to reform them to rejoin the society and also the economic waste for our society would be considerable .
In conclusion, I definitely believe the capital punishment should be carried out for it has the validity to exist and brings positive effects to our society. Sentencing an individual ?even if that individual is an unforgivable criminal? to death may not be the happiest way to maintain a safe society. However, I certainly believe that it is the most efficient method to prevent future occurrence of severe crimes and to make our world a safer place to live. I just hope that there are no more terrible crimes in our society that would lead us to take away one's life by compulsion .
