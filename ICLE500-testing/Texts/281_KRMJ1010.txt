Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
	Today's high school students constantly study to enter a good university. Most of them do their best to study for their future. By the way, after the competitive sequences, another barrier is waiting for them. It is the very getting a job. The employees working in different field from their original major is occupying considerable amount in Korean companies. That is, Korean universities' educational system does not have efficiency in respect of practicality as many students effort and study for a long period. If so, what benefit does it have to enter a university? Also, does it have the significant pass or fail-deciding points in entering company to have a university diploma? And, is it so important for universities they graduated from to have a good reputation? This writing has been written to think over that point. The ways for this are as follows. First, we will look at the annual income's height comparisons depending on the academic ability's differences. Next, we will see the university diploma's importance when people apply for companies. Finally, we are going to see the importance of the university's name of someone's having about trust in society. And, I will summary this with one utterance .
	Entering a university has many diverse benefits and the one of the things is the very salary differences. According to the "Payopen", one of the salary survey sites of Korea, the field having the biggest salary gap between university graduate and high school graduate was finance part, which gap was about 17million won. Also, according to the Korean national statistical office's second quarter survey this year, that kind of gap was investigated as many as almost double. Thus, we can confirm that university graduate earn more than high school graduate like above .
	In addition, having a university diploma can help us apply for companies. For example, suppose there are person A and B who apply for a company. If they have the same condition but A is university graduate and B is high school graduate, the company would choose the person A because it is natural the society give the person who leaned and invested more to the society the advantages for their effort. Also, the number of employees needed is getting be diminished because of the economic depression. Thus, competition rate is rising and companies are naturally choosing their new employees by academic ability. Therefore, it is no wonder university diploma is a very important factor of getting a job in a current society .
	Furthermore, the university reputation of each one's having is considered significant between people. Paul Herbig, assistant professor at Texas A&M international university, and John Milewicz, Professor at Marketing Jacksonville State University, insisted that the favorable reputation elevates the trust of the organizations between people. In fact, reputation is very important for deciding the person's impression in society as yet, so this is directly connected to an individual confidence. If a person graduated from a university which has a good reputation, people would see the person as a good way, so he or she would have a confidence. On the other hand, if a person graduated from an unknown university, the person could have a complex about the fact. Like this, the university name each person has would follow them for their whole life wherever they go and tends to be connected with trust and confidence. Thus, entering a good university would be worth investing our time and energy .
	As mentioned above, we have thought over the necessity of entering a university. First, we looked at the benefit of entering a university through the several surveys. Second, we saw the significance of university diploma when people apply for companies. Finally, we have thought about the importance of the university name of each person's having. To brief these to one sentence, entering a university, especially a good university, could be one of the steps occupying an advantageous location in our current competitive social structure.
