Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value.
 
 Many students believe that universities do not help students to get a career effectively. They say that because universities in Korea are too theoretical, they cannot provide a solution to the problem of unemployment. They claim universities should give practical curriculum that is useful for finding a job to students. I understand their requirement since a higher unemployment is one of the biggest problem these days. However, is it desirable for universities to neglect other important values and only meet their demand for employment? The reason why I throw this question is that there are many values for students to persue other than getting a job. In this essay, I would like to deal with true values that universities have to offer to students. First, this article raises the issue of lacking morality and mentions the roles of university by proposing a solution. Next, taking an example of Humanities, I put emphasis on theoretical education. Finally, by comparing two groups of universities, I explore good values that universities present to students. First of all, Universities should emphasize the importance of morality rather than finding a job. Recently, plagiarizing a paper has been a serious problem. Surprisingly, this is done by some celebrities who are highly educated. Despite how successful they are, they lack of morality. To solve this problem, universities have to educate students of personality education, which enables them to live honestly even after getting a job. One answer is to offer programs that remind students of morality. Also, they should let students know that ethicality, no less than getting employment, is important factor in their lives. Therefore, universities ought to take the responsibility of implanting a sense of morality in students .
 Secondly, although some students criticize the universities" education based on theory, I disagree with this idea. Rather, theoretical education enables students to have a better qualification for finding a job and to lead a successful life. Humanities that is one of the theoretical education is a good example. Steve Jobs stressed the essence of Humanities, explaining how Apple developed i-Pad. He argued that the courses related to Humanities play a key role in developing creative thinking. And he said innovative thinking is the most important factor that contemporary society requires. As we know from the examples of Apple, just learning practical skill is not helpful for students. As a result, An innovative thinking stemming from theoretical education including Humanities is advantageous for both career and life .
 At last, Values that universities suggest have a positive influence on students. According to the Ministry of Education in Korea, the study showed there are big differences between two types of universities. One type of universities emphasizes the virtue of high employment. Another type of universities gives students some values such as truth, serving, and love. It is found that the latter universities show a higher employment rate. On the other hand, the former universities have a lower employment rate. In addition to the higher employment rate, students in the latter group have a better understanding of the world than the former group. Consequently, good values from university"s education reward students with better results .
 As I mentioned in introduction, I look into what kind of values students have to follow and a variety of values that Korean university offer to them. In order to answer the question, I claim that universities should be in charge of teaching students the value of morality. And, I propose the significance of theoretical education in universities. Finally, I mention the positive effect of values from universities. To sum up, universities should suggest what is important and students judge what is desirable for not only their employment but also their lives.
