Title: Should the death penalty be mandatory for people that kill other people? 
 
	These days, our society has lots of unsolved severe problems. One of that is a capital crime. Many hideous crimes are being committed. Therefore now there is a sharp division of opinion about death penalty abolition. Which one is the best way for our society? Should the death penalty be mandatory for people that kill other people? In my opinion, I am in favor of the death penalty and I would like to explain why I think like that .
	First of all, death penalty prevents crime. It is a heaviest penalty so criminals are forewarned for that. It will be very powerful warning for them. For instance, in our country, capital punishment has not taken place for eighteen year. So in that time, the ratio of murder has increased about thirty percent. On the other hand, in Singapore, There were more than ten known executions in recent ten years. So there is no rapid rise in ratio of murder. It can be told that death penalty is effective for decrease of bad crime. It also shows we should execute it for keeping safety and maintaining peace in our society .
	Second, most of citizen in our country think that we need death penalty. Lots of people think that murderers violate the dignity of life so they have no right of the dignity of man. Therefore they agree to take place death penalty. They insist that we do not need to assure and protect about murderers because they break the law. Statistically, there are more than agreements than oppositions of this punishment. In addition, people are always worried about their safety, so they want to be protected. Death penalty will be at ease and they feel more comfortable. Therefore people insist it strongly .
	Third, there is a great economical loss. In Korea, a judge has sentenced criminal to death but has not executed a criminal for eighteen years. Therefore people who are sentenced the capital punishment become prisoners on trial. They are condemned criminals but serve a life sentence. The problem is citizen have to pay tax for the cost of maintaining criminals in prison. It is a waste of tax. Taxing is our duty and we can lead a well-being because of that. However our tax is wasted for useless thing. For our satisfied life, death penalty should be executed .
	All in all, I explained my opinion about death penalty. should it be mandatory for people that kill other people? I think we need to execute it for criminals who murder someone. First, this punishment is able to prevent the bad crime because it is a kind of warning for them. Second, many people who are living in our country want to take place death penalty. They recognize the necessity and start to insist it. Lastly, we need to execute capital punishment because there is a waste of tax for maintaining criminals in prison. The pros and cons of death penalty is still equally divided and discussed. It is very important problem that should be solved for our society.
