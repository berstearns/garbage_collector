Title: Should the death penalty be mandatory for people that kill other people? 
 
	The death penalty should be abolished. In many countries, death penalty is the still subject of controversy. Also in South Korea, the matter of death penalty is an endless subject between politicians, experts and the public. Korea has a death penalty by law but there was not execution in real since 1998. Many countries abolished the death penalty for the reason of human right between early 1990s and 2000. I think Korea has also followed the stream .
	There are people who claim the death penalty should be banned because killing someone deliberately, even if that was a law, is inhuman and it is against the article 10 of constitution; All citizens shall be assured of human dignity and worth and have the right to pursue happiness. It shall be the duty of the State to confirm and guarantee the fundamental and inviolable human rights of individuals. But, at the same time, many people support the death penalty, saying death penalty is an only way to compensate for the loss of one's life or most effective way to get rid of the heinous crime .
	I agree with both opinions in some degree but my opinion is that the death penalty should be abolished after all. The biggest reason of I don't agree with the death penalty is ' the possibility of miscarriage of justice . ' Death cannot be undone. If the real fact which opposite the earlier ruling is revealed after the execution, there is no way to bring back to his or her life. There is always possibility of miscarriage of justice because the judge is not a god and other evidence or fact can be revealed late. In addition, many statistics of various country show there isn't clear correlation between the existence of death penalty and crime rate. For example, in Canada, the rate of violent crimes is decreased after the abolition of death penalty. And in the United States, rather the crime rate of the state which has a death penalty is higher than other state which has no death penalty. Therefore, the idea that death penalty will prevent or can decrease the rate of crime is a just hypothesis. Some people also say death penalty can be used in politically .
	Actually, in the Korea, the reason many people support the death penalty is our sentence is relatively short compared to other countries. In the case of the crime that occur particular serious victim, victim or their family's worry, sadness and their anger at the assailant have to be resolved in the other way not a death penalty. Nation has to have a way to relive their life and to try to make or change the law .
	The debate about the death penalty will not end soon. But considering flows of the world, it will be abolished eventually and I think that is right. For the more democratic country, for preventing another unfair death.
