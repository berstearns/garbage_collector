Title: Should the death penalty be mandatory for people that kill other people? 
 
	Are you capable of killing somebody? I guess, Of course not. That is why I have a disagreement about mandatory of a death penalty for that kill other people even by law. we should be clear that Nobody can have right to judge other people's living and death. Everybody only have the human rights equally so, each person must respect the human rights of others. Have you ever watched 「Our Happy time」 featured by Dong-Won Kang? This is a story about a man who was charged with unintended murder and put to death. He committed a murder to protect his brother and regretted his mistake on the verge of death and wanted to live. but the end of the movie, he suffered the last sanction of the law. If you saw this movie, you could feel sorry for this and want to have a debate on the abolition of the death penalty. You must die because people killed. Is this fair? No it is not .
	On the other hands, we can see some people who are against the abolition of the death penalty. they insist that the murderer have to pay for their crimes in order to express the condolences to the grieving family. but we need to think who are going to judge their living and death. it will be a judge who is same as human. The most dangerous thing is a point that there is a possibility to take a innocent human life by a misjudgment of the judge who is a imperfected human. Also there is no a obvious basis that crimes are disappeared through keeping the death penalty. According to this, unfounded claims of Supporters of the death penalty are not reasonable because they haven't presented the fact to reduce the crime clearly. I want to give you one question. If you believe that the death penalty works to reduce the crime, you mean, can you hold public execution? we should think more carefully .
	As the Korean proverb says, "You can hate guilty of criminal but don't hate the existence of human." following this expression, we try to figure an alternative way out under certain humanitarian circumstances to respect the human rights. I feel the death penalty is inhumane and need to be stopped. There are a lot of countries where use of capital punishment, but recently?nothing?is?happening?which people are executed. Formal law is unuseful in our societies with many ways of punishment. I know that it is not easy to forgive an murderer but I want to remind you to ban on the death penalty with one proverb from the West . "To err is human, to forgive divine." Always you have to think who can have the right to kill some body.
