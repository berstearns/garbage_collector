Title: Should the death penalty be mandatory for people that kill other people? 
 
	A research concerning the repeal of the death penalty showed that 86 percent people of Korea did not agree on repealing capital punishment. It is still arguable whether it is right to abolish capital punishment. In fact, there have been no executions in Korea since December 31, 1997. Even though the death penalty has not been actively practiced for more than 10 years, most people believe that it is not necessarily needed to abolish capital punishment .
	Why do they think like that? There are some reasons why we should not yet remove the system of capital punishment: First, the rights of those who have been murdered should be respected. Some people insisting the repeal of capital punishment say that all men are equal before the law and the human rights of criminals also should be protected. I do not deny the equality of human rights. However, it does not mean that the death penalty should be banned for the rights of criminals. If the human rights of criminals who committed merciless crimes should be protected, then what of those who have lost their innocent lives and family with indelible scars?
	Second, this system can have an effect on prevention of crime. People who agree on abolishing the death penalty claim that crime rate will not rise even it is repealed. However, I think there are more possibilities that criminals could commit violent crimes when they know their acts will not result in their death. Therefore, keeping the system of capital punishment may help not only decreasing the crime rate, but also preserving the order of our society .
	The third is the perspectives of people on capital punishment. As I stated above, capital punishment has not been practiced for a long time in about 35 countries including Korea. In addition, the United Nations (UN) announced the moratorium on the death penalty in 2007. Nevertheless, why do a lot of people want to keep this system? Although we adopt the system of capital punishment, it is true that we have not actually hung criminal in effigy even they committed a heinous crime. It means that people think it is not necessarily needed to remove capital punishment if we are able to use this system properly for preventing a crime. The UN Moratorium on the death penalty also is about suspension, not through abolishment, of capital punishment around the world .
	Recently, it is true that a lot of countries have started to view the death penalty negative and agree on the proposal for a universal moratorium on the death penalty. Everyone knows that all men are equal and the human rights are important than anything else. In reality, however, it is difficult to solve this problem because we have to consider both victims' lives, their families', and criminals' at the same time. I think we are trying to respect their lives through maintaining the system of capital punishment, but not carrying out the system for a long time. For these reasons, I strongly believe that the time is not yet ripe for repeal of the death penalty.
