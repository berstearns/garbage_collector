Title: Is everyone really equal? 

There is really popular these days to talk about equality issues. There are an immense amount of projects that suggest the society that people are born equal and the equality should be followed in every sphere of our life. Women are proposed to be equal to men, black equal to white, poor equal to rich, disabled to healthy, etc. There can be no way we can distinguish ourselves or others as better than somebody else. However, is it really possible to demand equality while we all are so different, or too different to be equal .

On the one hand, the idea of equality is really important in modern society. This dose not depent on a country or continent. Everywhere on Earth people are equal no matter whoever they do or whoever they are. What are the arguments to prove that Black people are better than White or vice versa? Moreover, why do we need such distinction at all? Who said that we should devide all the people in one class or another? By this division unequality is followed . If you separate something from something you naturally distinguish one better than another (otherwise you wouldn't need to separate). Our entire perception of the world is based on the idea that one is better or worse that the other. However, everything we believe to be better is just the matter of our stereotypes, it is just the framework we are living in, it is just the truth somebody sais to be truth. For example, once I met a British women that was (and still is) working with mentally handycapt people. She has mentally disabled brother as well. But when I asked her isn't she afraid that her children can be born with mental disabilities that could cause some major problem with having a baby and rising it, she said she would be really happy if her child could be born like that. According to Davida, she would be have her own baby no matter what anykinds of disabilities he or she would have, and she would be very happy becouse she knows how to talk to these people, how to communicate, she understands them, etc. This fact really collapsed all my understanding of the disability as such, as a phenomena. This really gave me an idea that all the normalities are "normal" only becouse somebody claims them to be normal. And everybody is equal or should be treated equal becouse that is what we are: equal .

But on the othe hand, the only possibility for the things to be equal is to be identical wich is totally impossible in our society. There no identical phenomena as well as people. Therefore, by identifying their differnces we give our opinion about them wich leads us to the conclusion that something is just better than the other. Even if we do so unintentionally we are still identifying something to be better. The equality phenomenon explained in such perspective gives us no doult that there can be no equality at all, equality is impossible to happen. Moreover, we can illustarte this phenomena in any kind sphere of life. Taking into consideration simple company of friends (or even a family) and business enterprise. It is obvious that in buisiness hierarchy there is only moral equality among people as any communication is based on the issues of the hierarchy. This is the best ilustration for my title of the paper: "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others". Some workers are really more equal than others only becouse of their position and we cannot avoid that. Being (or trying to be equal) and reaching for equality would ruin all the company and buisiness. Even in the family affairs or our everyday we cannot be equal. If we take any friends' company where everybody is equal, in time some people would become closer friends and some would separate as it is the natural process of communication. Finally people would distinguish the others that thay like more and give them more privileges that other making them more equal. We can clearly see that there is no way of equality in our life .

To conclude, the idea of equality is very important in our everyday life. Everybody should be treated as equal no matter what they do or who they are. However, it is obvious that there is not such phenomena as equality. In todays world everything is based in your status in society. The degree of you, equality to others' depends on yor position in the world's hierarchy .
