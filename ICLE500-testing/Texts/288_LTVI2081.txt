Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

During the past 50 years feminist movements have flourished in many countries and reached the peak of their power. Lots of improvements concerning women rights and freedoms have been made. It seems that feminists having eliminated difficulties in all spheres of life and reached their goals, now live a perfect life. But, I would argue against this wrong assumption .

Firstly, women who fought for the right to get a top education, to make career equally with men, to be elected for high positions and to put on weight of great responsibilities, also had to devote themselves to sticking to high standards. Pscyhologically it is very hard and requires a lot of effort from a person. This leads a lot of women to emotional instability, nervuous diseases, addciton to smoking or even alcoholism .

Secondly, feminists who are associated with making their social life better and ignore men, often diminsh male role not only in their public activities, but also in their own families. Surveys show that these women tend to live without men and cope with all household duties alone and those who have husbands are said to argue for their rights at home a lot. This leads to an increasing number of divorces .

Moreover, feminists tend not to have children. They devote themselves to career making, traveling and self-improvement and many of them say that a child would spoil their life and prevent them from reaching their goals. The consequences of such reasoning are really sad. These career women stay absolutely alone and have no one to take care of them when they become old .

Furthermore, those feminists who have children usually bring up them alone. It means that they make their lifes really exhausting: they have to earn money and give education without any help. Working all day long these mothers have very little time to communicate with their children. This results in a loneliness of a child and cold relationships .

What is more, feminists change men attitude towards them because of their harsh activities. Polls show that men tend to be afraid of such women and would never mary one of them. Feminists are said to have gained a lot of male traits (speaking loudly, acting agressively, wearing trousers all the time) and in this way lost their femininity .

Thus even though women had reached a lot in fighting for their rights, it is not without a great harm that followed .
