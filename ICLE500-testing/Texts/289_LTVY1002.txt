Title: Is everyone really equal? 

 A famous saying by G. Orwell claims that "All men are equal but some are more equal than others". In my opinion this is true, especially nowadays when so many countries in the world declare that they are democratic, and this democracy is based on the human rights. It is very easy to say but hard to do, and everyone understands why it is like this .
 First of all, where there is democracy, there are certain classes of people. The classes of people lead to inequality as some of the people are well-off, they are so called, "the cream of the society". There is a middle class, people whose expenses are almost equal to their income, and there are the poor who may not even have money to buy a loaf of bread .
 The poor are always found in a democratic society which declares that people are equal according to all the laws. Even in the most modern and advanced countries the poor make a part of the society. It is enought o visit New York at night, and see how many people spend their nights on the benches, usually drunk or drugged. And, on the contrary, a visit to Moscow's street twenty years ago would prove the opposite. The ex USSR was a so called, union of countries, the citizens of which had no rights, who were dependant on the government and its decisions. Despite that, all the people had homes where they could sleep, and the had bread to eat. These two different countries represent absolutely different lifestyles, the politics, and the people .
 One more example could prove the inequality of people in the same country. It is not difficult to imagine two cars going on a highway. Let them be the same model cars but the drivers be the representatives of different social classes of the same society. If these two cars make two accidents, and both of the drivers are the perpetrators, it is easy to guess which driver will have more problems with the police. If the first driver is an ordinary amn working somewhere in an office, a so called representaitve of the middle class, he will have a lot of problems with the police explaining how everything has happened. And if the second driver is, for example, a famous politician, he will quickly talk with the police, give them some money may be, and go his way further on .
 In a way people can change their social status but it is a hard work, even if there is a strong will. Knowledge changes a lot. It enriches person's inner world, and may even help him to get a better rank. This way requires much attempt, of course, and time. Even in such a way it is impossible to amke all the men equal as not everyone has the needed possibilities and oppportunities .
 Thus it would be possible to conclude and to agree with the saying "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others". Whatever the structure of the society is, whatever classes it has, it will never be possible to establish absolute equality among the people .
