Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 

 In the days of old it was exclusively religion that was the source of solace for all the nations. Nowadays more and more people devote their free time to television instead of religion. The process could be named as a natural inevitability, as people have always been searching for new discoveries that, as a rule, eventually cast into the shade older ones, even those that existed from the very beginning. However, in this case there cannot be any question about an absolute substitution of religion for some better equivalent .
 Nevertheless, at least in one case, namely the one of disabled people, television can be that substitute that could help a person to live. Here we can talk not only about watching TV serials that without any doubt provide light relief as well, but also about live broadcasts of Mass, and interviews and speeches of churchpersons that provide an unquestionable comfort for disabled religious people .
 However, there are some more characteristics of television that make it more attractive than religion. To begin with, a TV set is always at hand when you need it, while you need some time to reach a church. Moreover, there comes into account other virtues of television, namely person's privacy and security, the bigger part of which one looses being in a public place .
 Another virtue of television that must be considered is that you have a huge choice of channels you have a possibility to watch; in the case of religion there are maybe few possible variants that you can choose from, as in my country, Lithuania, for example, you can choose among Catholic, Lutheran, Judaic and Protestant churches. Of course, there is another kind of religion that has not the best reputation on the whole, namely a religious sect. If we would count in a huge variety of sects alongside the basic kinds of religion, this tot most probably outnumber the quantity of channels .
 An indirect inducement to sacrifice or to buy something is another inherent feature of both religion and television. Though in both cases you are the one who has the right to choose what to do, in case you are in a church it is possible you will feel awkwardly if you cannot make a sacrifice, while in case you watch TV there is usually no moral pressure about some sacrifice, contribution or buying. This pressure is even more strongly felt if you are a member of some sect. Thus immediacy and correlation with the members of the group are the main factors that come into account in this situation .
 Another inconvenience is that it isn't considered to be a proper behaviour if you will stand up in the middle of Mass and leave the room without any reasonable ground, while television does not put on you any moral obligations - you can switch off your TV set at any moment without the slightest compunction .
 One more convenience that offers television is that you can do other things when watching TV, for example eat, talk with someone, be on the phone, etc. Participating in Mass you cannot do any of the things mentioned out of the merest respect for God and people around. Of course, you maybe will not be on the phone in the same room where other people are watching television together with you, and out of the same respect for others you will leave the room, but on the other hand, you cannot expect Mass being celebrated for you alone .
 In conclusion it must be said that there was held an argument for only a small number of conveniences of television, however, they make that basis of magnetism that attracts the masses .
