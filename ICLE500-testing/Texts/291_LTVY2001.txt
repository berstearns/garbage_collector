Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and they do not prepare students for the real world 

Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. Imagine, for example, an employer who is looking for a young perspective person to work in his firm. Most probably, the employer would like his employee to have some experience in the chosen field. But how is this possible if during the studies the young person had to learn only theory and had very little or any practice at all. Most probably, the employer would choose the person who has had practice and is an expert in the field. Not many very employers would like to engage a person without any practice simple for the reason that a non-expert can make mistakes, will not work sufficiently. So consequently, a question can be raised: how a university graduate can gain practice and is the university diploma so valuable .
 Most universities do not prepare students for their future work. Nevertheless, universities are very popular in our country, and it is a prestige to have a university diploma. However, our little country cannot offer enough workplaces for every graduate student. Lets consider the other question, that is, what about the quality of the knowledge that we gain at the university. Most probably, the American educational system does not provide students with sufficient knowledge. Most people think that Russian type universities are the universities that prepare good future specialists. They provide students with a great quantity of knowledge. However, some of people say that knowledge that students gain are more theoretician not practical. On the one hand, theory without practice is worth nothing. On the other hand, theory is obligatory for every educated person. And without knowing theory a student will never become a perfect specialist. As you can see, theory and practice are two inseparable things. Moreover, most students complain, that when they begin to work it is very hard to adopt, because theory and practice differ greatly .
 If universities provide students only with theoretical knowledge and do not teach any practice why at all, go to university and study. You can go to any library, get the same information, and not spend money for university degree. There, however, you cannot get a university diploma which is a certificate proving that you have a required quantity of knowledge. On the other hand, it is paradoxical, because the diploma cannot prove that you are a good specialist .
 As you can see, problem is great and I do not believe that it will be solved very soon. Probably the employers who test their future workers are right. They want to have only the best employees. And that is good. The world is cruel and when there are so many university graduates the less chances we have to gain good work .
 The educational system still needs to be perfected, as the requirements for a job are greater and greater. Universities should learn somehow to adapt to the requirements of the employers and to provide the country only wit the best experts. Otherwise, universities diplomas will not have any value .
