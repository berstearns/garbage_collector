Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 

 First of all, it is necessary to indicate that television nowadays is one of the main mass media. TV became an ordinary domestic appliance, which is purchased even by the poorest families. It might be even strange that some families have TV but they do not have a washing machine. Television already became a part of any apartment like electricity, heating and other services .
 Moreover, a little emphasis is put on the fact that people would not be able to watch various films on TV, without paying some additional taxes. That is any film or program is constantly interrupted by advertisements. The key is that lots of companies try to make people buy their products using TV advertisements. They are making money on advertising. The audience is almost hypnotized with endless row of attractive and colorful images. Finally, they are not able to avoid watching advertisements, because they are simply overpowered by the driving force of a film or discussion program. The images stuck in people's mind and when going to a supermarket they subconsciously choose the good as definitely the best .
 Eventually, television influences human's thoughts, attitude and even behavior. For example television presents various ideals to be followed. Women are constantly reminded that successful relationship with men is based on a beautiful thin body of a woman. So women are persuaded that they will manage to establish successful relationship only being fit and eating less. Children are fed up with images of self confident, clever and able to fight people. Men are given some information about political processes in the land. They do not think that a camera of a reporter might present information from different angles. Truth is often controversial. One could argue to death whether it is good or bad influence that television makes, but it is really obvious that people are controlled by television. A lot of people spend their leisure time in front of TV set. Children may watch cartoons endless hours. It is very often that people are not able to plan and control the time they are going to spend for this activity .
 To tell the truth, it was already accepted fact that cinema theatres were the only place both for poor and for rich, as well as for men and women where one could get rid of reality and daily problems. Various television companies were able to purchase expensive movies and to show them to people staying at home thanks to advertising industry. Movies, cartoons, discussion programs, concerts and other programs formed a great cluster of choices. Any representative of social, age or educational class could find the things he or she was interested in. Poor people were able to see the materialization of their dream of becoming rich. Disobeying, revolutionary ands restless teenagers saw their dream images of risking, witty, physically strong and attractive heroes. Ordinary housewives depressed by daily routine were able to see romantic men of their dreams .
 All in all, television became a tool of magic. People unconsciously became controlled by television. It seems they forgot that ordinary people create any television channel. Definitely they have some particular intentions and hidden ideas under the fibula of any visual product .
