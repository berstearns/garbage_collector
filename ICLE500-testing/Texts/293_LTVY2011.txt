Title: Money is the root of all evil 

 Nowadays it is difficult to do something without money. It is important to assume that whatever one is eager to do he must usually pay for it. The way one decides to invest their money depends on the man's ability to control himself and not to waste money vainly. There are two different worlds created by money, positive and negative. It is interesting that we live in both of them incorporated into one having virtues and vices. Many people say that all their problems are because of the lack of money. They think of them as the main salvation of the shortage. Notwithstanding, people who are rich do not fell happy as well. The problem is the way people use their money, not the social status one represents. Sometimes money brings joy and laughter, sometimes it causes only pain .
 First of all, the amount of money influences the quality of activities man is occupied with. For example, if you intend to have a good and active weekend, money plays the essential part, because it is necessary to pay for various gaieties, facilities. Furthermore, the basic role of money is to guarantee the most essential background for living. Similarly, people behave generously giving money for the poor. As it is obvious, money serves for high purpose which proves the positive side of the discussed topic .
 On the other hand, the world of crimes is ruled by the money as well. There are a lot of instances of such phenomena around us: people kill each other, steal from each other; moreover, envy is a very common characteristic feature among human beings. The creation of this evil is stimulated for the sake of money. In other words, evil is created of the desire to have more. A very common situation appears when rich people, already having everything, do not really feel any other necessities and plunge in negative habits. They buy expensive drinks, have drug addictions and do other money driven harmful things. Therefore, most people agree with the words of old song "Money is the root of all evil". Probably there is some sense in these words. Despite all the noble actions, some negative aspects are present that can not be denied as harm of money .
 Generally speaking, money should not be considered as the motivator of all the evil because someone has created them. It is indisputable that man did it. What for? Of course, he did it not necessarily for causing the harm but for the better function mostly. Thus, it is unfair to blame something else rather than human being himself. Here the misinterpretation appears because man is inclined to accuse everything except himself. Surely, the more just appropriate statement would be "Man is the root of all evil" or "Money is the root of evil as well as good". This affirmation sounds too strong but still such an argument is very fair in this context. After all, one spends money for worthy things as education, food, different house equipment, etc .
