Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and they do not prepare students for the real world 

 It is very important for everyone to have a good job and earn enough money for a reasonably well-supported life. People go to universities to get a degree so that they could get a better job. They believe that a degree of a good university guarantees their good future. Personally I think that a university degree is just a proof that one has a high education but it does not proof that a person is a specialist of some kind. It takes more than just to graduate from a university. Studies are only theoretical part of your education and I think that a degree without experience means almost nothing .
 People go to universities because they want to get knowledge and become specialists but very often they do not get what they have expected. A lot of things taught in universities are only theoretical and there is no way one could use them in real life. Furthermore, very often students do not have a chance to show what they know because they are given a lot of theory and there is no time left for practice. The only way to check the knowledge is exams. As a consequence of a too big amount of theory comes cheating. It is a very sad situation but a lot of students get a degree for cheating and not for what they know and learnt at the university. Of course, not all students cheat in universities. There are many of them who are honest and want to learn everything they are offered not thinking if there comes a time when they will be able to use what they have learnt. When graduating from university they know a lot of things but not necessarily they are able to use everything in life. In this case it very difficult to find a job because every employer asks if a person has any experience on a particular job. In other words, a university degree does not show if one can really do the job and many employers do not want to take a risk. It goes without saying that the best way to become a specialist and get a job after graduating is to combine studies with work. For many students this might seem impossible because studies take a lot of time but there is no any other way if they want to do the job they have been preparing for .
 Finally, I have to say that one's future depends on a person himself. A university degree can only help to build up the future but it does not give any guarantees in life. A student in a university gets a lot of information but not all of it is necessary. I do not say that it is not worth studying in a university. After all theory given in a university is the base of certain speciality. What I mean is that a university degree does not have so much value if a person does not have any experience on a particular job .
