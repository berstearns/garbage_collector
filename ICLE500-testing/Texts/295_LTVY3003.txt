Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

As political movement feminism began between the late 18th and early 20th century in Europe and in the United States. It was always based on the idea that women must have equal rights and opportunities as men. Several disadvantages and advantages of feministic struggle can be listed .
 One of the main disadvantages of feminism is the fact that it usually has a negative meaning to most people. This is a sequence of the tendency for feminism to occur in waves when each of it represents different kinds of feminists who often disagree among themselves on certain issues. For example, the members of earlier generation are being criticised by the later ones, who claim that there is still too little of attention being paid to women's problems. Consequently, another disadvantage appears as the cause of these disagreements. For instance, feminists of later generation believe that the society is still very patriarchal, and women are oppressed by it. For this reason, their attempt to make women dominate in society cannot lead to equality between the two sexes .
 But I think that there are more advantages that women gained from feminism than disadvantages. First, for women in many countries, the area of politics was forbidden for a long period of time. Until it was an exceptionally male activity, women neither could vote in the elections, nor took their part in ruling the country. As a matter of fact, feminists were the first ice breakers that changed the situation radically. Now women have equal rights as men to control the machinery of government and express their political opinion by voting. Second, notwithstanding sex, everyone today has a right to study and get a desirable profession. For example, feminists have proved that women may also achieve high results in studying science as well in the faculties of arts or women as well as men are good physics, doctors, and even astronauts. Finally, sexism is always a thorny question in feministic discussions because it occurs in different situations of life and causes many problems for women. Trying to get a particular type of job is one of the cases when women may confront with an unfair treatment of them because of their sex. For many years feminists struggled against this kind of phenomenon trying to stop it. Actually, they have already represented noticeable achievements. As a result, in most of well developed countries in Europe and in the United States women have equal opportunities as men to get a job. The great majority of employers organises competitions to choose one of the candidates not according to their sex but according to their skills and experience which is necessary in that job .
 To sum up, no matter what was achieved feminists believe that women are still oppressed in comparison with men, and that their oppression is unjustified. However, their struggle has done more good than harm to the cause of women because the attitude towards women has changed in many positive ways. Nowadays women are treated equally to men in politics, education, and workplace .
