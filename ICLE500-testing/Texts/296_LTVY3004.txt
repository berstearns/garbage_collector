Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

Although feminism has many forms and shapes, the main goal of it is to liberate women. Feminist movements started in the nineteenth century in the United States. However, the first feminists who joined the movement were treated more as individualists. Since then the strategies how to achieve and maintain equal rights in a masculine society have changed and developed. Most feminists are especially concerned with social, political and economic inequality between men and women. The majority of modern feminists believe that discrimination of women still exists wordwide. This essay is concerned with the the positive and negative causes of feminist movement. Since there are several points in favour to feminists, there are more things to be said to criticize modern feminism .
 The main advantage of the movement is that it has shown women's ability to fight for their rights in the society. First of all, women achieved the right to university education. After achieving this, they proved that women are better learners than men. The fact is that women now outnumber men in both high school graduation rates and university enrollment. Secondly, women are now free to participate in any sphere. This means that a woman can choose whether to sit at home with children or to run a bussiness, become a polititian and etc. If following, women are now free to initiate divorce proceedings. Feminist movements help women feel equal to men in the spheres of education, job and family .
 However, feminists are said to have done more harm to the cause of women. Firstly, after getting equal rights, women became in many ways similar to men. For example, it is now natural for women to demonstrate aggressiveness, dominance and even to dress like men. To continue, modern society puts a psychological pressure on every woman. This means that if a woman does not have a career, she might be treated as weak. Similarly, a woman who has a carrier cannot be equally devoted to her family. As a result, there are much more divorces than ever before. The growing numbers of children who rarely see their careerist mothers seem scary. What is more, there is a tension between men and women who want to dominate in the social sphere. Present situation shows that women compete among themselves more often than before. Moreover, men are now afraid of women's wish to become even more powerful in the society. By entering the social sphere, women not only become strong competitors but also act similarly to men .
 To sum up, feminism ideas can be viewed as positive for women because they encouraged them. Because of feminist movement, women have more or less the same rights in the society as men. However, the feminism movement have lost its positive values especially in the past ten years. Women entering from domestic to social sphere caused confusion in the society. By extension, more and more women forget their domestic roles and become career women. Seeking for career is seen as an advantage, but then someone has to be concerned with domestic matters as well .
