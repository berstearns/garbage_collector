Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and they do not prepare students for the real world 

 Nowadays more and more people argue that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Most probably they talk so from their own experience. Nevertheless, I think that studies at a university are still very valuable and give a lot of useful skills and theoretical background for students. However, very often students themselves claim that universities give them diplomas but not the skills .
 First of all, a lot of people think that after finishing universities students are not ready enough for the real world. Students at secondary schools study hard because they think they need good knowledge to enter universities, and this is true, and they also believe that this step will be almost the most important in their lives. They hear every day that an university is a place where students are taught a lot of interesting things, where they are able to get useful information in their field and learn various skills. However, after finishing universities most of them remain dissatisfied, because they think that they are not ready enough for the real life. At the end of their studies they, of course, have theoretical knowledge, but it is of very little value, because they have never used it in practice and, therefore, they do not know how to use it in the real world. In other words, due to lack practice young people do not know how to behave when they face the real difficulties .
 Secondly, university degrees are really theoretical and therefore many students have problems in finding good jobs later. Theoretical material which students get at universities can give important knowledge but it gives only basis of understanding what one can encounter in his/her workplace. At many universities, while studying the emphasis is put on broad understanding of many unrelated subjects rather than teaching job skills and giving practise. Therefore, nowadays many students think that there should be more practical work done in the field that one is studying. More and more students every year find that most of the courses they have taken are very theoretical and not very realistic and useful. Thus, because of that, later many students find out that their education has no correlation to the work they are performing .
 To summarize, there are a lot of different oppinions concerning university degrees. It is clear that a university degree is necessary to get better jobs. But there are people who say that university degrees are very theoretical and do not help students to prepare to live real life and find good jobs. Another claim is that a four-year university program cannot produce graduates who will require no additional training, because most universities teach the basic skills and try to lay a broad foundation of concepts that will support the graduates in whatever direction they decide to go professionally. However, every university teach students how to write and think, but to figure the rest of the real world out they have on their own. They have the whole life for that .
