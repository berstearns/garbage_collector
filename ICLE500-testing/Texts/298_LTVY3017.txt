Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good - this is an opinion that is shared by many people nowadays, at least in Lithuania. Nowadays the feminist movement in the world carries different connotations compared to what was when a movement started and most of their ideas are viewed negatively. However, one should not forget that the feminism has produced the significant effects on the women's rights and their position in the society. The feminism may be defined as a radical movement that tries to increase women's rights in the male dominant world, and I think it is a good cause to fight for. Therefore, the feminism is often viewed by those who do not like it as a hatred of the males. But of course feminist movement has achieved good results for many women in the whole world .
 To start with, the movement has positive consequences for the females because it encourages women to receive the education that enables them to look for the worthwhile and highly-paid jobs. In addition, when their self-esteem is achieved females prove that they may cope with the tasks as well as men do and, to be quite frank, in some cases even better .
 Second, women are no longer viewed as Victorian "angels in the house" as it was the case during the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries when the only and the main women's activities were related to the household tasks and children's care. Presently women are not expected to be only the mothers and the wives. Accordingly, the women may take part in different activities, such as politics or sciences. Before the feminist movement females have not been allowed to vote and in nowadays society women are elected in the parliaments or other institutions. And they work there very well, not worse than men .
 Furthermore, a tendency appears in the modern society that the women and men begin to share their household tasks and this is also a result of feminist movement. Men understand that wives are not the only ones who are expected to go shopping or being responsible for the washing of dishes or doing other household jobs. In addition, the new phenomenon, such as a paternity leave occurs in the society. This is a very important change in raising children when finally men understood that sometimes it is better for them to stay home and let wives to work. It is evident that the situation has essentially changed. Males agree to stay at home and take care of the children while their wives are making career. In such a case a woman and not a man becomes the financial provider of the family. Therefore, the gender roles are mixed, the females and the males behave not in a conventional way .
 To sum up, the major effects the feminist movement caused are felt in our society. Women have achieved more independence and empowerment. However, the current researches demonstrate that the men are still dominant in the positions where a leadership needs to be taken on. Thus, the females yet face the discrimination in different circumstances .
