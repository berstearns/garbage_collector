Title: Is everyone really equal? 

 Financial compensation should be an element paid for efforts and abilities to produce as much as one can. In my opinion, a man/woman's financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in. The compensation one receives should be appropriate with ultimate result. The more person is paid the better production at his/her workplace could be achieved, because financial reward is an effective motivator to do a job properly .
 Fair and reasonable financial reward is relevant for good morale at a workplace. Moreover, positive effects also come from good compensation. To illustrate, sometimes a very efficient staff do not produce as much as they are capable of. The low salary tapers off their efficiency and abilities to obtain the highest effect. However, employer expects them to work hard whole time, no matter how much they are paid. Therefore, they should be paid for what they produce. The harder they work, the more they should be paid. Besides, some extra financial reward would motivate them to achieve more fecundity .
 Employers should ensure that their organizations and businesses provide financial reward to their personnel for the contribution to the production. I think this has to be understood by employers in the first place. This leads a person to bigger motivation. Everyone wants to have a well paid work, be employed for good salary. However, I think a certain level of income should be associated with the endeavor to encompass the goal. For instance, man/woman given a specific work task may be passive, unenthusiastic if work is quite monotonous and repetitious. If the financial reward is attractive the one will complete the task efficiently putting all the efforts, because people think that money is a motivator. It really has an effect .
 Wages are normally paid per hour worked and workers receive money at the end of the week. Furthermore, sometimes other system of financial reward is used, paying only two times per month. It is very simple and easy to use for businesses. However, workers may be resent being paid the same salary as their colleagues who they feel are not so productive. Thus, I am inclined to believe that, the employee should be paid per item produced. In this way everyone would receive the compensation they deserved, the working atmosphere would be pleasant and the relationships between workers would be good, avoiding complaints of inequality. This also would give reason to manufacture more in order to earn extra, because no one could imagine his/her life without money. It is our source of better life, the way to more interesting and satisfactory life .
 To sum up, this argumentative essay introduces and briefly illustrates my point of view concerning a man/woman's financial reword. I strongly agree with the statement that financial reward should be proportionate with the contribution. Nowadays we live in a society which offers a variety of works, but not all incomes matches the production. Therefore, financial reward should be appropriate with hard work to motivate the person, to keep the positive working atmosphere and to maintain good relationships of workers .
