Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and they do not prepare students for the real world 

The aim of this essay is to describe what kind of problems could cause the lack of practice in university. These days students can get lot of theoretical material through the lectures in university, also they have possibility to use libraries or reading-rooms, though it is not enough to get good higher education. And the main reason for that could be lack of practical part. In this essay I will describe two problems, first one would that it is easier to learn something then you combines theory with the practice. Other thing, that lot of these days employer asks for couple years practice and I think university should be the place which has to prepare students .
 First thing to be said under consideration is the description of the easier way, how to learn material. In the way, then you are studying just theoretical part without practice it is very hard to remember everything. And if you are doing that also in practical way, it is bigger possibility to remember more material. For example the course of foreign language contains lot of theoretical material, but there is not enough practice. Students need to practice language is some way, because without practice, then you need to use it, it is very difficult. Firstly because you forget lot of words, then you are not using them, secondly students are not confident in their self and thirdly one of the most important thing for foreign language learners, it is impossible to learn pronunciation without practice .
 Second thing to be mentioned is the demand of practice from the employers. Students are trying to earn money for living and it is very difficult to find job according specialty, because one of request is couple years practice. Where students can get practice if they can not get work? The practical part in university could be solution of this problem. It would better for students if they would get job after university and for employers who would get good specialist, who knows how to do job not just theoretically, but and practically .
 And the last thing is opinion about that what we now can get in university. I don not think, that degrees which we get now are little value, because it depends from specialty. Though looking to foreign language learners, it is very important to have practice if university wants to grow good specialist. And according two before mentioned things it would be much better to get practice. There were mentioned just two things, but there is lot of facts, which would tell that theory is necessary .
 To sum everything up, there are more facts for practice, than against it. And if university purpose is to prepare good specialist, they need to take into consideration these kinds of things. Therefore the same students who university is preparing will work in each kind of work and in some part of their job maybe even in bigger, everyone would see, what and how he learn in university. And I do not think that anyone needs bad specialist and that student's opinion about university would be bad, because today everyone can get work of cashier without higher education and in this way there is no need to waste four years .
