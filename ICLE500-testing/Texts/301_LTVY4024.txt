Title: Money is the root of all evil 

Nowadays it seems that money is the most important thing in peoples' lives. The world became very materialistic, people seem to live to make and spend money. Madonna once said - "We are living in a material world and I am a material girl" and this truly reflects our society. Money means different things to different people: to some it is freedom, to others - nice things, to third - freedom, but the most important thing about money is the power, which is so desirable. The aim of this essay is to prove that words from old song "Money is the root of all evil" are true .

Firstly, money took over peoples' feelings. The world is full of rich men and women who are lost spiritually. Often seems that for most people money are more important than friendship, love or even family. People seem to forget what true things in the world are. People betray their family and friends for money, they lie, grovel; they are ready to sell their principles and themselves for money. Often young girls dream to marry a millionaire, preferably an old one, and get all his money when he dies. This shows how materialistic people are: they can sell themselves and also desire someone to die. People betray their principles, believes for money. Probably most people would sell their votes or take a bribe if there was an opportunity. When people get rich they often forget their friends, all true values in their lives. They become arrogant, snobbish, and associate only with people of high status in society. Another problem is that the human being is boundless and greedy. When he gets rich, he wants to become even richer and when he becomes richer he wants to become richer than that .

Secondly, all crimes happen because of the money. It seems that people can do anything to get money. They are ready to sell drugs, steal, sell people or even kill. Often when you want to get money, you have to take them away from someone. It is easier to get rich by stealing or selling drugs on streets than working legally all your life. Policemen and judges break laws by taking bribes. There is a problem of bribes in Lithuania in hospitals also. Money can cause such catastrophes as wars also. Wars happen most often because of the lands and profitable things like oil, gas and so on. Millions of people die just because of someone's desire to get enormously rich and powerful .

On the other hand, money cannot perform actions on itself. Money is just a tool. It is not the money, but people and their desire to be rich, get the status in society, power, is evil. That is why "The love of the money is the root of all evil" is the more correct form .

To conclude, the words from the old song "Money is the root of all evil" are true. Money causes a lot of bad things in the world nowadays. Because of the money and desire to get rich, people forget the true values: feelings like love, loyalty; their friends, family and principles, believes. People are very materialistic and they are ready to do anything in order to be rich and get some higher social status. Moreover, after they get rich they forget their friends and become greedy. What is more, all crimes, evil is being done because of the money. Money causes even such catastrophes as wars, where millions of people die. As money itself do not do harm to people, but people who wants to get rich and powerful are actually evil, more correct form of statement about money could be - "The love of the money is the root of all evil".
