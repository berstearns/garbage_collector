Title: Is everyone really equal? 

Constitution of our country states that all men are equal and if they break the law they have to take responsibility for their actions. Unfortunately, the real life is a bit different. You can always find a loophole in our legal system and remain unpunished. Also money and "the right friends" can help a lot .
 Unfortunately, in Lithuania if a person is a famous politician, or a sportsman, or just a rich person, it seems that he has more rights than an ordinary person. A lot of people are breaking the law by building their own houses in those places where constructions are banned. Usually if a simple citizen builds something illegally, he has to pay a big fine or the government instances demolish his building, but everyone knows that exceptions also exist. A lot of famous and rich people are building their own houses in nature reserves, regional parks and nobody cares because they are above the law .
 Moreover, people who work in a well paid governmental positions and participate in well sponsored projects like to take bribes and even to "wash" big sums of money. Just remember a famous project "Vilnius - European Capital of Culture", how expensive this project is and how many financial resources it has. The only conclusion which comes to my head is a big scam. People are stealing money from our country with no shame. Special Investigation Service just does not care even if somebody reports about illegal actions. Justice is only a ghost if you are rich. I hate to say this but corruption exists in every step of the way .
 Furthermore, even in XXI century we still have racial inequality. From the legal point of view all citizens of a country are equal no matter what race they are. But in the real life skin colour, religion and other believes still matters. For example, in Lithuania the Romany are ignored by other people and they are viewed as unwanted. It is harder for them to find a job and to have a normal life just like other people because of old thinking that all Romany people are thieves and drug addicts. Usually people think that if a Romany person lives in your neighborhood then you can expect a trouble and because of this they stick to each other and live in small groups. The Romany people have this kind of problems not only in Lithuania - as far as I know, the same is in United Kingdom, Spain .
 To sum up, on the one hand, we can say that we are all equal but on the other hand, when we really open our eyes we see that this is only a big soap bubble. We can only dream that someday everybody will be equal and no differences will matter. As for now, I can honestly say that money rules the world and if you are different than the others, just a minority in some kind of a country, you will not feel the equality. In reality such thing does not exist .
