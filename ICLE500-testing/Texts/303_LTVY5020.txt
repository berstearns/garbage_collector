Marx once said that religion was opium for the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. And by saying this he would be absolutely right . 
 The times have changed and the church has lost its power, but it didn't took very long for the society to find a new god to worship - it is the almighty silver screen. The magical box which emits pictures and sounds has long become a device which is an absolute must for every household. Just think about it - you go to your new neighbor's house to welcome him into the community and suddenly you notice one fatal flaw in his living room - on the cupboard where usually a television stands a potted plant. The first things that would pop into your head would be that he's either too poor to own a device which has become mandatory in every house or that he's plain weird. But in this case it isn't the neighbor who is the weird one, but you .
 Opinion polls say that in the past three decades watching television has become one of the most popular ways of passing ones free time. People do not read books that much anymore or spend long winter evenings socializing with each other. Now they got the ultimate time waster - television. Just with one press of a button on your remote control and you are already engulfed with entertainment. If your life lacks romance - switch on the soaps and you will be entangled in more love affairs than you can handle. If you need to add some extra realism into your daily routine - follow dozens of reality shows which are as real as a Loch ness monster. Nobody can withstand the "greatness" that is television .
 But I think that the entertainment comes at the high price. First of all, those who spend most of their time in front of the silver screen tend to have back problems from constantly sitting or lying in an unhealthy manner. Secondly, if you spend too much time watching TV, and furthermore if you do it in a dark, poorly lit room you soon may need to visit your eye doctor and get some glasses. Furthermore, doing nothing else and watching already given images deprives ones imagination and ability to fantasize, though this can be avoided if the from time to time spends some time with a book. And finally, some people, especially little children can get heavily addicted to it and start forgetting their own duties so they could spend more time with "the magic box".
 In conclusion, while TV isn't really bad itself, people started abusing it and depending on it way to much. There is no sin in watching the news, catching your favorite TV show or some movie from time to time, but when people start spending more than half of their free time lying around and letting the television do the thinking for theirselves, that is really sad .
