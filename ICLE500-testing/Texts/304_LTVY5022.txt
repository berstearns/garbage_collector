Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 

Television is a never-ending source of different information. Through the TV set screen we are reached by different local news or worldwide news about the current major events, politics, entertainment, sports and various commercials. From the first sight television could be called a great source of knowledge and entertainment, however it could also be called an effective time consuming machine or a perfect device for psychology formation what regards children or teenagers. The main point is that television has become the opium of the masses. They get not only addicted but also influenced in different ways. According to Marx, some time ago religion took the same position in the society. Nowadays, television has taken a very important place in people's daily life and most of them cannot even imagine their lives without it. Watching TV, they become a part of consumer society, they let their children be influenced by different harmful programmes and finally even adults get tricked or also influenced in different ways .
 First of all, the commercials shown on television should be put under consideration. Everyone has experienced that annoying feeling when the favourite programme or some compelling movie is interrupted by forever-lasting commercials. Although people do not really plan to watch them, they are still being introduced to the unnecessary information. So this way they are forced to watch even what they do not want. Moreover, what is introduced in the commercials, which take an incredibly lot of time in the day programme, is different advertisement of a great range of goods, medicines, various services, concerts, etc. Basically, various commercials that are shown on television grow consumer society and increase their demands and wishes. These few minutes' presentations of some kind of goods or services give promises that usually are never fulfilled, however they still programme humans' brains to wish, buy, consume but never satiate. Thus the commercials is one of the most evil and time consuming part of the television .
 Another point to be dwelled upon is the influence of television over the children and teenagers. They get used to what they see and this way they become rather indifferent to the violence or cruelty as they watch such scenes in the movies or news reports. Human brains that cannot distinguish reality from the artificial actions and views accept everything as real and make those admissible. This way children and teenagers or even adults with minor mental disorders or those who are very ductile might be extremely touched by violent or other kind of highly emotive scenes and their psychology might be irreversibly damaged or later they might repeat the same action in reality. Thus the television becomes one of the tools that increase the rate of crimes .
 Beside the commercials that grow consumer society and the influence made upon the infants, the television makes people believe the artificial world created in the screens to be reality. Sitting at the TV people try to forget their problems and run away from their current reality. However their problems cannot be solved while they are sitting in front of the box doing nothing. What they get is addiction that is very harmful to their psychology. This way of relaxing does not prove, as watching TV brains still have to work the same as they did at work, because they cannot distinguish reality from the artificial world. By nature, brains react the same way and they do the same work as if they were experiencing the real events. Therefore, people after relaxing at the TV set feel even more exhausted. Besides, watching TV sooner or later becomes a great addiction no matter of what age the TV lover is. This way the freedom is restricted and no profit is made .
 To sum it up, television rules people and take their time. Shortly, it becomes like opium and the person that is addicted to it needs it constantly and the need to increase the doses appears. However, the main points while discussing this mischief would be commercials that contribute to the dramatic growth of the consumer society, the influence on the children and teenager's psychology which is in the process of forming and finally people begin to believe that they will escape their problems while watching TV, though addiction is the only thing they get .
