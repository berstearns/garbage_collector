Title: Money is the root of all evil 

In the words of the old song "Money is the root of evil" the reality of today's world is revealed. As we can see from the contemporary situation there is a big difference between people who are wealthy and those who exist below the poverty line. The question is, what is better, to be wonderfully wealthy or absolutely poor? In my opinion, there are three main points why money can be called the root of evil. First of all, people who have a lot of money also have power that can be used for bad purposes. Second, people who are very rich feel a constant need for more money which can grow to obsession. Third, people who are rich have to worry about how to protect their money. Therefore, it is better to focus on a different goal in life than money .
 An important point that shows the evilness of money is that people who are rich possess the power over other people which can be used for the bad intentions. First, they may try to use their superiority for bad purposes, for example, corruption. People who have a lot of money may think that they are better than others because of their wealth. Therefore, they can use their money while trying to take a better position in politics. In Lithuania it is quite common to hear about similar cases when wealthy people try to buy themselves a better position. Moreover, there are many cases when rich people pay money to get a permit to do something that is illegal for ordinary people. Second, people who have a lot of money and therefore feel powerful may want to conquer those who have no money. For example rich countries like America or Russia possess large amounts of money and therefore they dictate the rules for the rest of the world. These countries may also want to conquer and appropriate the resources of other countries that can not fight back. Hence, money gives power that, if used for evil intentions, can cause serious problems .
 Another point that proves the words "money is the root of evil" is that people who already possess great wealth always seek to get more money. This obsessive need for money can lead them to some troubles. First, wealthy people usually try to increase their income. However, this may be done by violating the rules of law. That is because people who are wealthy feel almighty and think that money can save them from any situation. Second, people who have a lot of money and are always trying to get some more can never feel happy. They feel constant need to increase their income so they forget more important things in life. Such people can not feel happiness because of their obsession. They concentrate on their businesses and therefore neglect their families and friends. Although they are successful in their careers, such people end up lonely and sad because their personal lives are unfulfilled .
 The third point that shows the dark side of money and wealth is that people who are rich have to worry about how to protect their money and therefore they start to feel suspicious about everything. First, rich people may loose their friends because of their paranoia. Such people can not trust anyone and therefore they end up alone and unhappy. Second, because of constant worrying about their wealth, they get stressed and experience many health problems that can even lead to death. Third, people who have no money usually are much happier, because they have nothing to worry about. For example, people who live in the countryside are much more relaxed, because they are constantly surrounded by healthy environment which protects them from unnecessary stress. People from the countryside do not possess great wealth. However, they feel satisfied with what they have .
 In conclusion, all these examples show that money is not key to happiness. On the contrary, money is the root of evil. People who are very rich usually possess power over others that can be used for bad purposes. Moreover, constant need of increasing the amount of money can lead people to obsession and leave them alienated from their families and friends. Finally, big money makes people feel constant stress while thinking of how to protect it .
