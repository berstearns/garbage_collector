Title: Money is the root of all evil 

It is an old saying that good women had vanished when money appeared. This is an ironic expression but no one will argue that it contains at least a little bit of true. Everything centres around money and it is the biggest power in the world. Moreover, it is the evil as well. Some ideas about it will be discussed in the essay, such as what influence does money on people lives and on society in general .

To begin with, it can be said that all problems start where circulates big money. It should be said that everything appears from the individuals' psychology and thinking. The two examples could be given to prove this idea: a poor family with the very low budget lives in the miserable conditions and thinks how to raise their children, let to the school and pay taxes. Of course, from the surface it could sound like a very big problem but to dig in this family individuals' inner emotions and feelings this problem decreases instantly. Why? They know how to fight for the place under the sun, their relationships with each other are stronger, and the most important thing, they know that they do not have nothing but the family. This type of people learn to appreciate little things, and to share their happiness with the others. Another example is about the rich family. They have a lot of money and can satisfy all their needs, even if they are much higher than ordinary people. This type of people loose the burden of shortage but on the other hand, they loose the moral appreciation of non material things, such as love, respect and assistance. They begin to live in disrespect, spending their days counting the money. What way of living would you choose? Here goes the question but the answer depends on each individual .

To go further, the society is very highly corrupted nowadays. Last week the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 was held in Moscow. Lithuania won the permission to perform in the final. Everybody was so eager to hear that Lithuania would be at least at big five. Unfortunately we took 23 place from 25 performers. The song was very strong and well done, so the one answer must be that the decision about the winner was taken despite the all European countries voting. This was only one example from millions. Each person have faced corruption in his life. The worst thing that the handful of bureaucrats will do everything for their own comfortable future and many people will be left to stand on their own two feet after the big deception. I am writing not to judge or to defame someone but I believe that many people would agree with me .

In conclusion, this saying "more money more problems" would perfectly suit in this context. There is lot of evil in the world, such as disrespect, murder, illnesses, diseases and much more. Where did it come from? When did it start? Despite all things that do not depend on human beings the rest woes lie on the shoulders of money keepers .
