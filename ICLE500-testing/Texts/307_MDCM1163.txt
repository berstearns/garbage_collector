Title: Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated? 
 
	We live in 21th century where the criminal acts are increasing more and more these days. We live in society where the social norms are different for all people, it depends of people character which way of life to live to be good or to be bad. The kind of life some of the people live is really dangerous for other people, because they made such terrible acts that are not normal in any society it the whole world. The most important thing is that more and more people are included in the every day fights with crtiminals and they tried to diminished the criminal acts to minimum .
	Criminals should be imprisoned not rehabilitated because they made such terrible acts like murders, kidnapping, they stole things that are not in their own property they sell drugs they are capable to affect and to destroy people's lives. They are the bad guys in one society which is destroyed day by day by doing bad things. The criminals acts in the whole world are really huge and they are everywere. They must be imprisoned and they should be there because their acts must be punished really bad, because being rehabilitated is a gift for them is not a punishment, no matter of their mental health they must be punished. The best punishment for them is to be faced with all bad things they made to destroy people and the society in which we live, also they should be imprisoned and to have a chance to feel all the bad things on their own skin .
	To be rehabilitated means to help them to solve their mental problems and then to start doing bad things like before. There are small numbers of rehabilitated criminals that after they complete their medical tritments they stop doing the things they made before and they are transformed in completly new persons, that is not the case with most of them. Huge number of criminals in the world that are rehabilitated are making more terrible acts that are of big disadvantage for other people. They are capable of doing such terrible things that are distroying the lives of the normal people and change sometimes the norms of living in health and save society . 
	In conclusion, like I said it is really bad way of punishment to send some of the criminals to rehabilitation and to give them the opportunity to help them, without first to have the chance to face them with their acts. In some cases where the criminal acts are not so terrible the rehabilitation can help and can try to made good people of them, but in most cases the only punishment for such acts like murdering and selling drugs, kipnapping is facing them with the acts in the prison. If we want to have a heathy and safe society for all of us we should try to face with the criminals and to be sure that they are going to have the punishment they deserve .
