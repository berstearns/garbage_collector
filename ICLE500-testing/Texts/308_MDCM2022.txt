Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
	Nowadays money is a powerful "tool" used by people all over the world. Since forever, the lust for power and money overpowers people and makes them do things they never though they would do. However, money itself does not posses any evil characteristic, but people's inability to control their greediness does. People are given a chance to choose what they will do with their money, and they can use it to help the people in need or fund a research.
	First of all, money can be used to help people who need it most. We constantly hear "cries for help" by people who were hit by an earthquake, tsunami or other natural catastrophe. In such instances people collect money and goods that will be used to help the people in need to re-build their houses, or repair the damage that has been done on their property. Additionally, there are many charities that help orphans, people who battle cancer, victims of domestic violence etc. These charities are funded by wealthy people, celebrities etc. whose money is used to help the people who desperately need it. It is commonly known that chemotherapy is an expensive treatment and unfortunately not all cancer patients can afford it. That is why the existence of such charities is vital for the survival of many people battling cancer. Another example of how money can be used for good causes is the donations/scholarships given to students with low income who are intellectually smart and want to continue their education . 
	Second of all, researches are very important when it comes to discovering new things, and are fundamental for the development of our world. Researchers are constantly working on projects, and very often these projects are funded by influential people with "deep pockets". Such cases are the donations made by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt who donated to "Global Action for Children", "Doctors without Borders", "Namibia Red Cross Action Program" and plenty more.
	However, there are many people who blame money for people's inability to control their lust. Blinded by the power that comes along with money, they are ready to abandon their moral and ethical values. Those people believe that money can buy you everything, even happiness and love. But, if money bring the worst in people and make them lose their humanity, their ability for empathy and love, then why there are so many examples of people who used their money for good causes? That is why we cannot say that money itself is the problem, but it depends on the person, how they depict the world and how much control they have over themselves . 
	All in all, I believe that money itself is not causing harm, but people who are unable to control themselves and their greediness. Unfortunately, nowadays people are more and more interested in acquiring wealth, than the harm they are doing to themselves and the people around them. I believe the world would be a better place if people started to re-question their decisions and behaviour instead of blaming it all on the "green pieces of paper".
