Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
	Nowadays, more and more people aim towards enrolling at a university and pay a lot of money in the hopes of obtaining a degree. Everyone considers higher education essential for having a successful career. However, the question of whether this higher education actually helps students be prepared for the real world or not remains. It is not as simple to put into practice what one has learned at the university as students believe. The important thing is to learn how to adapt to a new environment. Thus, this essay will look at several concepts, such as the economic aspect of studying at a university, the importance of practice, and the skills that universities should provide the students with .
	Amy Gutmann, a political theorist, stresses the economic aspect of being enrolled in a university. According to her, students who graduate from a university, i.e. those who have a university diploma have higher chances of employment than those who do not. Even though most recent graduates are not convinced by this and consider universities as a waste of time and especially money, the evidence which Gutmann found proves that they are mistaken. The annual income of employed graduates is almost two times higher than that of the employees who have only finished secondary school. Thus, they will regain the money that they have invested in university. Nevertheless, Amy says that she is aware of the fact that "few people are so economically privileged that they can afford to be motivated solely by the love of learning for its own sake" [Reference] . Consequently, many students who want to go to higher education cannot do it because of their poor economic situation. Therefore, universities should provide more scholarships, or any kind of financial support, for people that come from families with low income .
	Other important concept is the practice that students should have. University degrees are, in most cases, theoretical, and the theory alone is not enough to prepare students for life after graduating. Larry Alvarado's opinion on what the focus of universities should be, is clearly seen in his statement: [Quotation] [Reference] . 
	The students must feel prepared for life after graduating. That is the reason why universities should strive to provide internships for students, where they can apply their knowledge of theory into practice. The idea is that, while studying, students do not feel disconnected from the real world. In spite of the fact that there is a year or two, provided by the universities, when students can put their learning outcomes into practice, that is not enough for certain professions. Unfortunately, not many universities try to bring about changes in that field. The diplomas continue being theoretical and mainly useless to students once they have graduated . 
	The fact that universities do not prepare students as much as they should is evident in a research that Peter D. Hart conducted on behalf of "The Association Of American Colleges And Universities". In this research, recent graduates stress the need for developing certain skills that will be necessary for whatever profession they decide to choose. In every profession, regardless of what university degree students have, the ability to be able to work in teams, to think critically, but also to communicate, both orally and in writing, are skills that are needed and valued the most [Reference] . This phenomenon is also present in the universities in the Republic of Macedonia, where the students have similar thoughts. Being a student, I am familiar with this, and I consider such skills as crucial for further development of each individual in the real world. These skills should serve as a supplement to theoretical knowledge, and being able to apply them will more likely lead to success. However, little attention is paid to these skills in most universities, rather the focus is just on the theory .
	To sum up, despite the importance of theoretical knowledge, it should not be the only aspect on which universities focus their attention. There should be internships provided by the universities, and with them students would be provided with the opportunity to transfer their knowledge of theory into practice. The degree that students get should be relevant, and worth the time and money spent in order to get it. It will have value if universities' central point is not just on information about the specific field of studies of students, but also on certain skills, such as teamwork skills, critical thinking skills, communication skills. If all of these things mentioned above are implemented by universities, the degree will have greater value, not just to students, but also to their future employers .
