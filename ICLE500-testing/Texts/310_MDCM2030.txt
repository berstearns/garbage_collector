Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
	For hundreds of years women have aimed for women's rights. Feminism at its core is mainly about empowering women, about the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities. The term feminism can be used to describe a cultural, economical as well as political movement for establishing legal protection for women. In a literal way, man rule the world, but this made sense a thousand years ago when the physical strength was the most important attribute for survival. However, today we live in a very different world . 
	Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is a feminist. She is a Pakistan activist for the right of education, especially female education. Malala began writing a blog under a pseudonym because of the Taliban attacking girls' schools. After she revealed herself, she continued to speak up and took action on global education by opening a school for Syrian refugee girls in Lebanon. She shared her father's passion for learning. Malala in one of her interviews said [Quotation] [Reference] She is considered as a very influential person and Pakistani Prime Minister said that Malala is the pride of Pakistan.
	Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a Nigerian novelist, who won a lot of awards, famous for her book "We Should All Be Feminists" influenced women including famous people such as the singer Beyonce. Parts of the speech from a TED talk are sampled in Beyonce's song, sharing a very important message . [Quotation] [Reference] .
Chimamanda calmly, consciously and convincingly encourages women. Chimamanda also encourages men to actively think about gender, arguing that society brings boys to think that way.
	Women who have also done a lot in the field feminism and are considered as the most important feminist icons are Coco Chanel, whose designs helped to liberate women through fashion in pants and suits; Rosie the Riveter, representing women who have fought in the WWII and reminding us of the incredible female efforts during the 40's; Eva Peron in the 40's who founded the "Female Peronist Party" and helped women the right to go to university; Bell Hooks, an American author known for her works "Ain't I a Woman?", "Black Women and Feminism", "The Feminist Theory", in which she declared [Quotation] ; Coretta Scott King, mainly known for her marriage with Martin Luther King Jr. who also helped found NOW (National Organization for Women), Virginia Woolf, arguing that talented female writers face impediments to fully realizing their potentials: social inferiority and lack of economic independence for which she proposed five hundred pounds a year and a private room for female writers; Hillary Clinton, Oprah, Angelina Jolie, Emma Watson.
	All these strong women are making changes since the beginning of the feministic movement. It is important to pay attention to the ambition behind it rather than the word itself. Both women and men are responsible for making this come true. Women should fight for equal rights for men and men should fight for equal rights for women. I do not agree that feminists have done more harm than good. On the contrary their contribution is remarkable and liberating. Thanks to them, women are able to speak and raise their daughters in a world deprived from prejudices against women.
