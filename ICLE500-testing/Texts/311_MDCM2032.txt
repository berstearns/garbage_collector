Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
	Education is one of the main sources in every person's intellectual development, affecting our lives in one way or another. Moreover, it still remains as a silent issue of discussion with less or no effort done to understand our educational system and the presenting of knowledge to young and imaginative human minds. In comparison to the past, more and more of the young people decide to dedicate themselves to their studies and intellectual improvement, believing that the money and the effort put in it will be of great importance in their future life as young educated individuals. The main issue which is going to be discussed further on is whether the university degrees are of real value, and whether they prepare people for the real world.
	To begin with, all of us are aware of the purpose of the university studies. What the real question is, whether the studies succeed in realizing the purpose. The university students are forced to memorize information, but what they really need in order to be prepared for the real world is personal growth training, financial management training, communication training, emotional intelligence training, and healthy living training. Some people believe that the university is not place where life skills should be learned, but rather an educational institution which prepares students for job-careers. The problem is that statistics show that 53.6% of college graduates, under the age of 25, are out of work or underemployed, which is yet another thing to bear in mind when thinking of the real value of the university degree.
	David Ellis in his article for "The Telegraph" discusses the way universities teach students to fail in "real life". [Quotation] [Reference] He says that a degree is nothing more but a proof that you wanted to learn, can learn and will keep learning. It shows your mind has been [Quotation] [Reference] . What he tries to say is that the university degree is simply not enough. People make mistakes by encouraging too many students into university, and at the same time forcing them to believe that the purpose of the university is entirely professionally oriented.
	The previous article goes hand in hand with Aliezah Hulett TED-Ed Club talk on the topic "Preparing Students for the Real World". She raises questions as: "Are teenagers today prepared for life after school?" The school system and parents should be working together to raise educated students. Schools should be accountable for instructing students to be knowledgeable about the world around them. It should be a joint effort between parent and educator to train the next generation of children to be independent and prepared for the real life. One of the topics discussed is whether university student would be able to handle the sense of responsibility and maturity that comes from having a job. When someone puts their head down to achieve their goals by themselves, as an independent adult, their outcome will reflect what they learned in both college and "real life school". Similarly the Northeastern University economists Paul E. Harrington and Andrew M. Sum argue the most pressing problem facing the university graduates today: overeducation on one hand and malemployment on the other. The reality is that more and more college graduates are stuck in low wage and low skilled jobs . [Quotation] [Reference] Also, this article contains an example of a certain graduate student S.F. who got a degree in Network and information-technology administration, and after he couldn't find a job, the Eastern Michigan University gave him a job as a custodian in the student center. This very example makes us consider the value of the university degree and ask ourselves whether the degree is really needed in order to become successful and financially stable in the future or it is just a way to manipulate the hard working students and make business based on their effort and hard work.
	All in all, the university degree is not an infallible way for safe and great career as many people consider. When students enter the real world, besides the knowledge gained from education, they need wisdom and specific skills that are not offered in our educational system. Therefore the universities do not produce real-life prepared students and the university degree is not valuable in a way of guaranteed job or career opportunity. The world demands people who can think creatively and differently, take opportunities to compromise their true dreams and hopes, and grow a personality by breaking the boundaries of the everyday teaching.
