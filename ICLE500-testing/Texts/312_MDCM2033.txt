Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
	Universities that want their students to be successful should introduce practical training in their programmes. The number of students entering some of the universities in their country increases more and more every year. Students are keen on studying further what they are interested at most. They choose what their profession or vocation will be. However, things are not as simple as they seem. Most universities lack practical training. Therefore, students are engaged in studying theory only. Later on, when they finish university and look for a suitable job, students are not very skillful at what they are doing. In this essay I will show evidence that university degrees are of very little value and do not provide students with the necessary knowledge in real world.
	First of all, the professor William T. Vukowich who teaches Contracts, Bankruptcy and Commercial Law at the Georgetown University Law Centre, argues that law school graduates lack practical training. The students need more practice in regard to legal tasks and court procedures. He says that [Quotation] [Reference] . Moreover, Vukowich [Reference] says that law schools put an emphasis on theoretical studies. He states some factors that influence this lack of practice. First, he says that the physical environment in the law schools is one of the major factors that have an impact on student's lack of practical training. Most law schools have moot court rooms, unfortunately designed only for lectures and not for mock trials. Second, the intellectual environment of the university is also crucial. Vukowich suggests that [Quotation] [Reference] . He says that one of the major problems in creating conditions for practical training is that it will require a lot of individualized treatment. Teaching in large court rooms seems easier and does not require individual attention.
	Second of all, Jeffrey J. Selingo is a professor of practice at Arizona State University. In his article for The Washington Post, Selingo interviewed Marie Artim, who is the vice president of talent acquisition at Enterprise. Enterprise is a company which recruits college athletes. Artim says that athletes possess transferable skills . [Quotation] [Reference] . Selingo also says that bosses have complaints in regard to colleges which do not prepare students for the global job market. He elaborates on a study which shows discrepancy between what the businesses need and the readiness of the college students. In this study, only 25% of the employers say that students were creative and innovative . [Quotation] [Reference] .
	Third of all, the research "How Should Colleges Prepare Students to Succeed in Today's Global economy?" was conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. The research included interviews with employers, graduates of a four-year college and some business executives. Some of the executives are critical of the education that is offered to the students. They say that education is theoretical and does not prepare students for real world. Some of the comments of the executives are: [Quotation] [Reference] . Yet another statement in regard to the preparation for real world that colleges offer to students is: [Quotation] [Reference] .
	All in all, there are many evidences and real-life examples in which graduates lack practical skills. Their knowledge is only theoretical and do not prepare students for what is necessary at the position they apply to. Every university should prepare new programmes in which the emphasis would be on practice, not on theory. The arguments of professors Vukowich and Selingo and the research of the Peter D. Hart Association are worth considering if universities want to improve their programmes. Thus, they should focus on developing student's skills rather than offering them theory. Otherwise, the degrees would not be as valuable as they present them to be .
