Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
	It was back in 1844 when Karl Marx wrote his famous and most quoted statement "religion is the opium of the masses". Nowadays there is still controversy regarding what he really meant by it. In my opinion, he saw religion as a means of controlling the masses. Were Max alive at the end of 20th century, he would have replaced religion with television. In this essay, I will discuss why television can be seen as the opium of the masses, focusing on three main reasons: coinage and real meaning of "couch potato", essentiality of television for maintaining social infrastructure, and promotion of culture of violence and fear.
	To begin with, it was the appearance of television that brought about the coinage of "couch potato". Nowadays, the image of a typical TV viewer is that of a couch potato: [Quotation] [Reference] . In most of the cases "couch potato" is only associated with the negative influences it has on health: weight gaining, increasing the chances of diabetes and heart diseases, alcohol and drug abuse. Nevertheless, there is more to couch potato than just negative health influence. It affects both life and mind of a person. For instance, it might cause loneliness and a change in well-established habits . [Quotation] [Reference] . Or in other words, one might be regularly skipping family dinner in order not to miss their favorite show, or preferring to stay at home and watch television rather than go out and socialize. What is more, [Quotation] [Reference] . Alarmingly, a "couch potato" person may be rightly called a hypnotized person. Studies have shown that while watching television, the mind is affected and alpha waves are produced by the brain, leaving the person in a light trans.
	Secondly, hypnotized population is what governments need in order to maintain the well established social infrastructure. A study conducted by Krugman proved that while watching television only the right hemisphere of the brain is active. With the left brain hemisphere numb, the brain [Quotation] [Reference] . In addition, another study by Thomas Mulholland shows that alpha waves are produced by the brain after only 30 seconds of watching television. Alpha brain waves are [Quotation] [Reference] . Conversely, watching television is neurologically analogous to staring at a blank wall [Reference] . Both studies imply that television brainwashes viewers' brains and acts as a kind of opium, a drug essential for maintain social infrastructure. Brainwashed viewers do not critically judge or question what is presented to them. Governments might broadcast information and as much of it, as they think the citizens should know. As an example here, I would like to mention the current situation in my country. It is a turbulent period in Macedonia and every day people are protesting on the streets. However, on the vast majority of national TV stations the protests are not mentioned, and when they are, they are referred to as "vandalism". 
	Last, but not least, television can be used to promote culture of violence and fear. Television as the opium of the masses does not only make people uncritical towards what they see and hear, but also by broadcasting a lot of violence and violent-related news, it makes people afraid. This culture of violence puts the people in constant state of fear: fear of murder and assault, fear of airplane crashes, fear of violence, especially violence amongst children, and fear of cultural domination. For instance, during the time of Ronald Reagan's presidency in America, the government sponsored TV commercials that, [Quotation] [Reference] . What is more, airplanes are often presented as an unsafe mode of transport, even though [Quotation] [Reference] . Another fear that the television has produced is the fear of differences between people. Racial, ethnical, and religious stereotypes, as well as stereotypes based on sexual orientation, and occupational groups are often presented on television . [Quotation] [Reference] .
	To sum up, television can be rightly regarded as the opium of the masses. From the 20th century onwards it had transformed people into "couch potatoes" and it has spread a culture of violence and fear among the people. Moreover, by manipulating and presenting selected information it had been used to maintain the social infrastructure. No doubt, if Marx were alive at the 20th century, he would have replaced religion with television in his famous statement.
