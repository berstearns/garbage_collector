Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
	Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men to produce them. In the world we live in, one needs money in order to survive and be happy. Nowadays, it is impossible to live without money. Money is the key to getting most of what we need and want. People want money for various reasons, for surviving, for security, status, to be powerful etc. It is factual that money gives people power to succeed and to get what they want. However, sometimes excess power is used is a wrong way, which creates evil. In my opinion, money is not the root of all evil but human beings with their evil thoughts and actions, and in order to support my opinion I will elaborate on my ideas about how money affects society, how important it is and does it really make us happy.
	Firstly, it is clear that money is something very important. People need it in order to achieve their life's goals and supports, because most of the things in the world are related to money. People need money for their health care, because they can't resolve their health problems without money. They use money to buy food in order to provide nutrients to their body. People need money in order to study. For example, if a student has money, he or she can buy books, newspapers and computers to research and gain a lot of knowledge and information. So, if people have money they will feel more comfortable and confident to solve many difficult problems in their lives, especially in the areas of health, daily needs and education . 
	Secondly, money is not everything but it's something to make our life easier. But money has its own limitations too. Some might say that money makes them happy. But is it true? Because you use money in order to buy something but can you buy everything? We use money to buy material things which might make us happy. For example, someone might buy the phone of their dreams and be happy but is it true happiness? We can buy a lot of thing with money but we can't buy love, happiness, courage, discipline, manners, morals, trust and respect . [Quotation] says Catherine Sanderson, a psychology professor at Amherst College, [Quotation] . [Quotation] notes Dan Gilbert, a psychology professor at Harvard University and the author of the book Stumbling on Happiness. Money can give us power but also can make us selfish and lonely . 
	Thirdly, money itself it's not an evil, it is harmless. In fact evil comes from money users, that are we, human beings. Money is labelled "an evil" because of our thoughts and actions. Because of money a lot of crimes occur as robbery, theft, burglary. People are willing to commit crimes because of their greed. They desire wealth, status and power. Greed is one of the seven deadly sins and people do many evil things in order to get rich. The Apostle Paul, in his first letter to his young disciple, Timothy, had this to say: [Quotation] [Reference] . This verse is often misquoted as saying "Money is the root of evil" but it's not money itself the root of all kinds of evil but "the love of money" which is greed. Wealth is morally neutral, there is nothing wrong with money, or the possession of money. However, when money begins to control us that's when trouble starts . 
	To conclude with, I think evil is not caused by money. Money looks like an evil because it is used by "evil" people to accomplish their "evil" plans. People themselves are considered as the root of all evil and money is only a "victim". It doesn't mean that all people are evil, I believe in humanity, that everyone is born pure and good. However, evilness is present and it is up to us, humans, to decide whether we will choose to use money for good purposes or let the money use us for the evil ones .
