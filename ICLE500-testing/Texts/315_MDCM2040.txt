Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
	In the past, religion was the force that controlled people's lives, thoughts, customs. They obeyed every rule and were convinced that the church has the ultimate power over them. People were blinded, and the church dominated their lives. The church, for example in medieval times, had great wealth, political power and influence over community life, art, architecture and education. The middle ages are quite often called the Age of Faith because religion was so pervasive in European society. All in all, in medieval times people didn't see things reasonably and were quite blinded. As Karl Marx put it: [Quotation] [Reference] . However, that stays in the past and another opium for the masses was discovered - television. Television replaced the religion, but it has quite the same purpose - to make masses subordinate and believe In what they see on TV.
	To begin with, television is a medium that is intended for large audience recipients. People around the world are constantly in touch with the presence of the mass media. What is more, every child nowadays is born with computer and television next to it. We are totally occupied by the new technologies and new electronic gadgets, and eventually we can't think with our brains as the time comes, we would start believing in what we see, which is not always right, according to the eminent scientist that grasp this concept in their studies.
	Secondly, mass media, including radio, TV and newspapers, have huge influence in determining and shaping people's ideas. I personally think that mass media controls our mind simply because of the commercials, the movies, and songs we see every day. If you see a beautiful girl with nice clothes and wel shaped body, you would like to have that dress and her body! Some experts claim that hidden subliminal psychology is being used in the modern media industry to achieve the desired results with their video materials. These have changed our lives to a great degree. First, they affect peoples' views on fashion. We wear clothes that may look like what famous actors or singers had on recently. What we watch on TV, radio, what we read in newspaper and magazines affect us in a great amount. When choosing what to wear, most of us have a tendency to choose what is said or shown to be fashionable by famous people. Furthermore, it is evident that the mass media also plays an important part in our attitude towards life in general. Some people complain that the young people today tend to be more lazier and more violent and aggressive and feel they need gadgets as much as possible. This is simply the result of bad programs shown on TV all the time, websites with no control whatsoever and even the parents' carelessness. Some parents allow their children to surf the web, without noticing that on Internet there are challenges which the young have little experience how to deal with them. People, especially young adults, always have an idol and they tend to imittate what their idols do no matter if these things are good and desirable or bad.
	Thirdly, the saddest thing that happens while we watch TV is that we become more and more subordinate, we believe in what we see and we don't develop the critical thinking. As Bill Hicks put it: [Quotation] What is more, studies suggest watching television for longer periods changes the very structure of a child's brain and decreases their verbal abilities. Even much worse effects could possibly exist: although a cause-and-effect connection is hard to prove, higher rates of obesity, antisocial behavior and mental health problems are in correlation with the hours spent in front of the TV.
	To conclude, mass media (TV) is a powerful tool used to manipulate the masses by the ruling class. It defines what is normal and acceptable and shapes people's opinions and attitudes. What is not presented on the TV channels is regarded as unimportant. There are numerous events and things that happen in the world, but if TV companies don't think masses should see that, they don't broadcast that. Television definitely controls the masses, however it is our right to choose whether to watch it or not.
