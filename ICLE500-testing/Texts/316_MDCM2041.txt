Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
	One of the most frequently quoted and paraphrased statements of German philosopher Karl Marx is "religion... is the opium of the masses." [Reference] The quotation is taken from the introduction of his posthumously published work "A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right". The introduction written in 1843 was published in 1844 in Marx's own journal "Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher". People are inclined to be somewhat religious and spiritual. Religion offers an easy escape from reality, it presents as the one good thing that makes life worth living and it definitely helps to take the pain away from the struggles of life. In this essay we will look at the thing that make television the opium of the masses in the 20th and even the 21st century .
	Marx understood that religion served a purpose in society, but that purpose didn't hold to be true. Religion teaches moral, values and beliefs that a society will damage. At the time, opium was seen as a painkiller, so one interpretation of his quote is that people turn to religion to ease the pain of their everyday struggles. The basis of Marx's argument is that humans ought to be led by reason and that religion masks the truth and misguides believers. He believed that when society and life are viewed through the prism of religion, they are so blinded that they cannot see the realities of life. He considered religion to be a false hope and comfort to the poor. He realized that the poor used religion as something that brings comfort in their situation, thus prolonging the process of alienation . [Quotation] [Reference] 
	Nowadays, most people spend more time watching television than going to Church or praying. Some people make heroes out of people on TV. TV obviously shows people what they want, but at the same time it teaches them nothing. It provides a perfect escape from the real world, just as religion did before. More and more people talk about soap operas, quiz shows and advertisements. Advertisements make people materialistic and at the same time unhappy about themselves and the things they have. The fact that people take TV as reality is worrying and it might be said that TV is the blind fold of the 20th and 21st century . 
On the other hand, not all TV is bad. Television is just a medium like the radio and the internet. Every one of us enjoys a certain TV show, but we need to be very careful about the thing we expose ourselves to. Many shows present violent, inappropriate, materialistic programs and sometimes children are the main target of these programs. It is obvious that TV is the easiest way for relaxation and entertainment. Moreover, it is the biggest and the quickest source of information. There is nothing wrong with enjoying TV shows or allowing children to watch some TV, but you have to keep in mind that all of us are exposed to a certain propaganda. In his paper Perry Marshal, advertisement expert, wrote the following: [Quotation] [Reference] . 
	In conclusion, opiates are a form of escape for many people, much in the sense that religion and even television are. Religion offers hope to people who are in need of such assistance. Faith is something that will ultimately improve their views of a number of issues and that is why it is considered to be an opium of the masses. Television also offers some sort of consolation. People sometimes need an escape from society, but it is very important not to get stuck at some unrealistic, utopian place that only exists on the screen .
