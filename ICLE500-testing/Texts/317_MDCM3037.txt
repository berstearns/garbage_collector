Title: Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated? 
 
	The obligation of the criminal justice system in every country is to respond to an offender's wrongdoing. The primary role of the system is to arrest the person who has committed a criminal act. Committing a criminal act means that a person has violated the rules of the society and represents a potential threat to reoffend or even hurt innocent people, who must be protected. The first thing towards protecting innocent people and preventing the offenders to perpetrate another crime again is to take them away from the society. However, it is debatable whether criminals should be imprisoned or rehabilitated. Regardless of which solution we choose, we are facing several issues . 
	Every properly-working society needs to punish and clearly condemn criminal actions, especially severe and brutal ones. By doing so, we convey the acknowledgement that victims have been wronged and we achieve justice. In reality, it takes months, even years until criminals are being apprehended, taken to court and sentenced. In order to work, punishment must be applied to the maximum intensity. Furthermore, criminals must be sentenced immediately. Otherwise, the effects are temporary and we provide opportunities for other offences to be reinforced. Also, it is important that low-risk offenders be separated from high-risk offenders. If not, long-term contact between the two groups would only increase the risk of recidivism. In my opinion, long prison sentences should be appointed to brutal criminal deeds, such as heavy robberies, armed robberies, human trafficking, drug dealing and smuggling, organized crimes, genocides, murders or multiple murders performed by the same criminals. More so, the committers of these crimes need to be put in a solitary confinement and sentenced with the highest possible punishment. For example, if the average life expectancy is seventy-five years of age and the offender is thirty years old, than the sentence should be forty-five to fifty years long. This way, reoffending more serious crimes in the future will be prevented.
	At the same time, if we rely on punishment only, we fail in making our societies safer. Also, were facing with problems like overcrowded prisons. For less severe criminal actions, longer sentences are associated with higher rates of reoffending. That way, when prisoners return to the societies, the problems multiply. In order to prevent this from happening, we must include rehabilitation as an addition solution to the problem. That is why it is crucially important to treat them as soon as they have been incarcerated.
	The first step towards a successful rehabilitation is thoroughly selected and trained staff and well-organized program. Thus, we can be certain that the highest quality services are delivered to the most complex and challenging people. However, these psychologist are not valued enough, but more, they are being criticized when something goes wrong. The idea of the rehabilitation is improving and reforming a prisoner for a better integration upon his return to the society. The programs for rehabilitation usually include anger management therapy, educational programs, group therapy, workshops, etc. It is hoped that through this process criminals would be less inclined to commit crimes in the future. Its goal is to prevent them from committing another crime by taking away their desire to offend. Rehabilitation should be considered for less serious offenders, especially for first time offenders. We again come upon the issue of overcrowded prisons. Imprisonment, especially elongating prison sentences can cause anger towards the police and the criminal justice system, and these people are highly likely to reoffend after they have been released from prison, many psychologists agree. With rehabilitation psychologists can help criminals improves their behavior. This would be useful for both while serving their time in prison and integrating in the community after the end of their sentence.
	As it can be seen from the preceding examples, rehabilitation has positive effect, but they would have been achieved without previously imprisoning the criminals who committed those crimes. This means that we should encourage rehabilitation more and have a much greater respect towards the people who make these changes happen. Furthermore, we should combine these two solutions. That way, we put criminals aside, we change the violent behavior of offenders and stop them from reoffending, and the most important thing is that innocent people are safe when former prisoners return to the society .
