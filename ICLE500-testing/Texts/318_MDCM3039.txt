Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
	Every man is constantly shaped and influenced by his experiences. I find money the root of all evil for the following reasons: it makes people greedy, creates faulty values, and divides people according to social status.
	First of all, love of money is a recognized evil, that is born out of an excessive desire for it. There is a famous proverb that says "Greed begets sin, sin begets death." Furthermore, people in developed societies are in a vicious circle. They work hard so that they can earn more money. When they have more money, they spend more. The greed for money increases and they are never satisfied. And then, because they spend more, they have to work even harder. The circle goes round and round.
	Secondly, money caused a twisted turn in the real values of life since the times people started using gold and silver for trades. Health, family, friends and moral values were once a priority and not a concept. Marketing and advertising is overwhelming the population presenting idealistic images of high life styles and stressing the materialistic, hindering the spiritual. Therefore, people are subconsciously guided to worry more about the physical appearance of things. For example, with help of money, people undergo thousands of surgeries to gain a look appealing to the advertised standards of beauty. People find enjoyment in expensive comforts and have forgotten about feeding the spiritual, appreciating moments and people. The paradox is that they are losing their health, to pay for things and later on will be losing their money to pay for their health.
	Last but not least, there is the problem of dividing people according to social statuses. Society often judges people according to how much money they have, therefore money equals status. Rich and famous people receive better treatment in some institutions than poor. Usually, people of higher social status do not mingle with people of lower social status. People tend to look down on other who have less money than them. An example of this, could be the fact that in the past, marriages between two people of different social status were disapproved. Today, these marriages are always under the question of being out of interest. Moreover, money equals power. Many leaders of nations are completely disregarding the needs of the common people who support them. They manipulate and strive only towards accumulating their wealth.
	However, many may argue that money isn't the root of all evil. That excess of money could also be used for noble causes. Thus, Bill Gates donates millions of dollars through his foundation to help children in developing countries. These kind of people are guided by noble thoughts. People can argue that even without money, greed still exists and that crime is not triggered only by the possession or lack of money. For example, rape could be a result of lust, and murder a result of a quarrel. Moreover, some people think that money isn't the root of all evil, but rather the lack of money. Money is the result of hard-working process. Also, money motivates people to work smarter and harder. But then again, on the other hand, if there was no money, the lack of it, wouldn't adversely affect anyone. In my opinion, all the fears mentioned only exist because we need ' money ' to buy stuff. And if resources were distributed freely and equally, there would be no need for them.
	In conclusion, the question of money being a good or a bad thing, is debatable, but the fact stands that our world has become a dangerous place to live in, where decency, moral and freedom are just fading concepts that very few of us still remember. On a personal level, we ought to worry less about our image and bear in mind that too much power and wealth steals away piece of mind . "Being" and "doing" are much more important than "having". And ultimately, some evil may not have a lot to do with money, but most money have a lot to do with evil.
