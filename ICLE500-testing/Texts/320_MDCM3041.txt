Title: Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated? 
 
	It is said that society gets the criminals it deserves. There is no such thing as crime free country, but how criminals are treated may change their lives, the whole system and the country's future as well. Certain approach will give certain results, but what is the right one? Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated?
	There are several names such as prison, detention center, correctional facility, jail, penitentiary etc. all for the same facility in which people are detained by force and sentenced to serve for a certain period due to the seriousness of the crime they had committed. Today's prison system is similar with the old established system centuries ago. Once the state was formed as a civil organization and the written language evolved, codes and rules were set as a legal base for well and rightful society. Every disobedience resulted in legal measure and punishment. Poverty, as a background for most of the crimes committed, is also a reason for the rise of the prison facility. In the past, if people broke the rules, they were supposed to pay a fine to the country, however, because of the great poverty, they were unable to pay the fines and the authorities set the imprisonment as a recompense. Imprisonment, than and still today, stays for punishment, but, not only for punishment - for power and authority as well. It is a way of showing how the country can execute its power by punishing. For instance we can take The Stanford Prison Experiment which is a study conducted by researchers led by Philip Zimbardo, psychology professor, in 1971 at Stanford University, California. This study dealt with the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard, so, half of the participants took the first role, the other half the second. In this paragraph we will focus on the second group, the prison guards, and the effects and the consequences of their role in the study. Professor Zimbardo took only mentally stable and nonviolent students for taking part in his study, but very shortly it was noticeable that the guards started to act really brutally and sadistic towards the prisoners. They insulted them, gave them pointless task to do, harassed them in any possible manner just because so, no need or any sensible reason behind that. This, of course, led to change in the prisoners' behavior - not in the positive way though . [Reference] The importance of this study is that has shown how this type of behavior and surrounding affect prisoners. Even though this is just a study simulating prison life and imprisonment, it is a reflection of reality indeed. Criminals are changed in prison, but for worse, and once they get out of there are even bigger threat than before.
	On the other hand, rehabilitation means restoring something to its original state and when it comes to people it means assisting to return to their normal, healthy life. Rehabilitation is mainly associated with institutions made for people who had an injury, surgery, trauma or suffer from some mental illness and this type of institution led by doctors and professionals help them to recover. Obviously, criminals do suffer from some kind of disturbance since they commit crimes not applicable to the common sense. Rehabilitation will help the criminals to overcome their personal issues, it will help them to socialize again, to cherish the right values and not to be harmful for the people surrounding them. This process is really important in dealing with criminals because it will open a new horizon and opportunities, it will help them during the legal act not to feel only punished and humiliated, but it will make them understand and willful to change. The aforementioned Stanford study was mainly aimed to show the changes in prisoners' behavior and the conclusion was that even mentally stable people in that type of surrounding started to act submissively, to show signs of depression, emotional disorder, to lose their own identity and identify with the prison life. Some of the participants had to leave the study because they could not endure longer and it might have led to permanent health damage. These consequences are the opposite of what the prison's purpose should be. Criminals are people who need help and what should be done is a rehabilitation implementation.
	When we talk about crimes and the reasons behind, and the purposes for, and the degree of the crime - we can only judge and criticize as passive observers, not being aware that behind every crime lies a mental and emotional disturbance as undeniable core. The long lasting imprisonment practice did not give positive results, maybe a new approach will improve the system and certainly it will benefit society as a whole .
