Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
	The technology has developed tremendously over the past decade. Thanks to technology our lives are much easier. Transport, for example, is a lot better and much more affordable. Entertainment is another aspect of our lives that has seen a great improvement. Construction industry has also experienced the benefits of the developed technology. However, when we think of technology nowadays we think of smart phones, computers, tablets. This modern technology facilitates our lives. But where are the children in this whole picture. How does it affect them? Technology negatively affects their imagination and dreaming, as well as creativity . 
	Let's first focus on how children learn. Children notice everything that surrounds them. They notice new ideas, new concepts and try to understand them and construct knowledge of them. Children born in this digital era are surrounded by technology so their brain develops in accordance to these concepts. That is why it is a no surprise that a 3-year old child can use a smart phone or a computer. The statistics show that 90 per cent of the 14-year old children use a mobile phone. Also 56 per cent of the children who are at the age of 10 to 13 years own a phone and even 25 per cent of the children who are at the age between 2 and 5 years have a phone . 
	The first point is how technology affects children's imagination and dreaming. In today world of technology there is no need for imagination. If we compare children born a decade ago to children born the past few years, we may notice a difference in their imagination and dreaming. The reason for this being the source of entertainment they had. Let's say toys, for example. They had the opportunity to express their imagination through those toys or even without them. Children used their imagination to entertain themselves. Now the technological inventions are becoming more and more popular and far more interesting to children. Only through one click on the computer or the tablet the children have access to many different ways to entertain themselves. There is no much room for imagination and dreaming here. Everything has been already done for them. What is concerning is that sometimes the parents are those who impose the technology to their children. One excuse for this is to keep them busy and another excuse is that the children do not have another entertainment. This should not be an excuse to impose technology to children because there are many things apart of the technology that can be much more entertaining and at the same time enhance their imagination.
	The second point is the effect technology has on creativity. Studies have shown that creativity is innate, children cannot lose their creativity. However, if it is not looked after, it can be suppressed. The internet offers a great amount of information. New information is uploaded every second. Children know that everything they need is available on the internet. Now since they know where to find what they need, there is no place for creativity. This in turn leads to lack of effort to remember things. Knowing that the necessary information is available on the internet, children do not bother to remember it. There had been a research conducted in 2010 on creativity and the results had been compared to those in 1970s. It had been found out that there was a decrease in American children's creativity. Children in 2010 could not produce as creative ideas as could children back in 1970s . 
	In conclusion, technology has a negative effect on children's imagination and creativity. However, children cannot and should not be stopped from their exposure to the technology because technology is not here for a short period of time, it will stay here forever, people cannot escape it so cannot children. That is why children should be led into the technology world carefully. It is certainly that they should be exposed to technology but the technology exposure should be balanced with other types of activities like reading and outdoor games which will stimulate their imagination and creativity and at the same time prepare them for the today technological world.
