Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
	Nowadays, people climb on the mountain of society longing for higher positions and power within it. They perceive money as pillars that hold the society and keys that open the golden gardens endowed with power, happiness and stability. The worse thing is that they act wickedly in order to reach the top of that mountain. But, is all this wickedness justifiable? Or Is this strive making humans equal to beasts, craving to sink their teeth into the prey's skin? From this rises another question, Is money the root of all evil? Money causes delusion in people's mind, evokes the deeply rooted avarice which is a dreadful sin and is guiding principle of one's actions and behavior into the world .
	The unquenchable thirst for money makes people avaricious. In the bible Timothy states that [Quotation] [Reference] . This means that if people want more than they have and more than they need, they become covetous. Hipoccrates' epistle to Crateva describes the avarice as a plant that need to be reaped in its root, for all diseases, affecting the human body, to be cured. The dream of gaining money in order to enjoy numberless pleasures, which rich life would offer them, could be depicted as that dreamy dome Xanadu with enchanted gardens, trees and ancient forests, which Colleridge immortalizes in his poem Kubla Khan. Democritus Juniorin his book Anatomy of Melancholy, imposes a question of why would a man work all his life, carry the load of suffering and miseries on his back, live a life like a fool, if he does not gain any pleasure from gaining money . [Reference] Nevertheless, man's eye is never content with what it has, but strive to gain more and that strife makes one avaricious .
	Money imprisons people ' minds and distorts perception by causing delusions. From psychological point of view, our mind creates concepts, developing them into images, which are the fountains of our thinking and believing. Namely, people create a concept in their minds that without money they cannot do anything and what's worse that only money can satisfy their needs. At this point, they become delusional and create some false realm that physical world underlies the basis of living and existence. This reality in which the physical world satisfies the human needs confines human soul reaping it into million pieces. The imprisonment of human mind is also a result of the fact that people [Quotation] . Sanskrit shunya describes this self-centered ignorance empty, meaning that there is no significance or essence in it. It is stated that things are significant if they are connected to everything else. In fact shunya means [Quotation] [Reference] . Nevertheless, money distracts us from the things that make our lives happier such as love, friendship, making us blind without being self - aware of ourselves .
	Money guides one's actions and behaviors, because one's actions [Quotation] - stated Bond in his introduction of the play "Bingo". According to him, people use money in order to influence the others around them who are also blinded by the power of the money. He goes on stating that humans do not have natural rights but that these rights are governed by the money . [Reference] Furthermore, money kills the dignity and all human values, because one cannot prosper into the society and gain money while having values and dignity. This means that people's heart need to be corrupted in order to gain money. For example: People due to their sick ambition and aspiration for money and power need to be cruel, to betray, to commit fraud and to kill their way only to become successful. Hence, money creates certain abstract convention, which evoke the animal viciousness within all humans and if someone aspires money she/ he must live by those conventions .
	All in all, money makes people covetous. All people want more and more and this is the root of all miseries, tortures, and remorse. Money is madness of the soul, blindness, plaques of the family, love as Cyprian and Bonaventure describes it. Furthermore, money makes us deluded, confines our soul, and makes us only self-centered, thus separated from the other things existing in the real world. Since we are only self-centered we cannot function, because there is not essence in our existence and we are empty and hollow, according to shunya. We must be connected to the other natural thing in order function. We must become self - aware of who we are and what we are doing in this world; what are the things that truly make us happy and contend? Finally money makes us to behave in particular ways, it is like it puts invisible abstract conventions that we must follow in order to achieve our dreams of becoming successful. But, following these conventions destroys our inner values and our human dignity .
