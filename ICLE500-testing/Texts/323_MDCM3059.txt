Title: Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated? 
 
	Should we give the criminals a "second chance" and rehabilitate them or should we put them in prison and treat them as they are the worst creatures? This question causes debate during the last centuries. However, every country in the world has its own legal system and the things are different in different countries. Every act of criminal is not the same and there is a difference between criminals.
	From my personal point of view, there are many, many pros and cons, ins and outs about this debate and I think that is very difficult to make a decision about should we put the criminals in prison or should we send them in some centre of rehabilitation and teach them what is right and what is wrong.
	Firstly, I think that we should take in mind the age of the criminals because nowadays we have criminals who do not have 18. Then we should know the mental situation of the criminals and to find the reasons which caused the criminal to commit the act of criminal. Every detail of the life of the criminals can be important to find about the reason of commiting a criminal act. I think that the psychological state of the person is the most important in these cases. And also I think that every prisoner should have the right to see and talk with a psychologist as they have the right to see a lawyer. And when the court is deciding, I think that the information of the psychologist should be taken in consideration. That will help to decide if criminals deserve the chance of rehabilitation or not . 
	On the other hand, if I think about the cruelty of the criminalism in some cases I feel furious and I don't think that such kind of criminals deserve rehabilitation. We are witnesses that every day in the world we have murders, terrorism, drug, prostitution, pedophiles, victims of violating, maltreating and abusing, and so many others difficult acts of criminal. And who is responsible for that? Yes, the criminals, criminals who thought they had the power of God to take the lives of the people. Should such people deserve to give them a second chance and rehabilitate? Should they not deserve to pass every day of their lives in prison? We are all furious but we don't have the right to decide about this.
	As I said this debate can not be finished during the last years, people don't have the responses of these questions.
	All in all, I couldn't decide whether the criminals deserve a second chance or not, do they deserve to rehabilitate and to be better people. But, I am sure that they should be punished and they should take the responsibility and accept the decision of the court about the acts they did. Everyone should pay and repent for their sins. We are all humans, we are not God and we do not have the power to do everything we like to do.
