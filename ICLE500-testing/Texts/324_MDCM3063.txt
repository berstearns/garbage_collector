Title: Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated? 
 
	After someone is found guilty of committing a crime, they are bound to spend the next years of their life in jail. But are we right to leave prisoners to decay locked up, with penalties and sanctions as the main objective, or perhaps we should give them access to educational classrooms, creative workshops and activities which would aim at their rehabilitation? Or would such a treatment do more harm than good?
	The criminal justice system costs most of the countries a great amount of money, does not provide rehabilitation, and above all, makes many of the inmates even worse than they were when they were first sent to prison. In fact, many researchers claim that the fact that prisons cause discomfort and unhappiness is the reason why they are unlikely to rehabilitate their population. The current public approach is to be harsh with criminals, which, as mentioned above, sets punishment as the chief purpose of prisons. The result is still a dramatic rise of the number of prisoners, whilst the effect on the crime rates is nearly insignificant. The danger of being sentenced, regardless of the length of the sentence, will not lead to discouragement for anyone who feels certain that they can get away with committing a crime, neither it will discourage those who are incapable of properly judging the consequences of their behavior . 
	On the other hand, the main target of rehabilitating the convicts is changing and improving them, so that they would be able rebuild their lives when they are set free. After undergoing such a procedure, it is more likely that they will be less willing to persist with criminal activities. Instead of making the prisoner afraid to break the law, or removing his physical ability to break it, the focus in this case is on taking away the very desire to do wrong . 
	However, this does not imply that felons should not be imprisoned - only that we cannot expect imprisonment itself to change behavior. The sentence should be governed mostly by the gravity of the crime itself. Therefore, it is right to incarcerate criminals who have committed serious crimes, like homicide, and rehabilitation should be an option for minor offenses. Also, first time offenders with milder convictions when only incarcerated, would just be enraged and this would provoke feelings of resentment towards the authorities and those in power. Instead of this, rehabilitation in the sense of guidance and working to help someone, would reshape their behavior and understanding, and later they would more easily adapt to a community . 
	In this context, it is important to conclude that there is a need for a system which will be more humane and which will have the necessary qualities to reshape the lives of the criminals, instead simply putting them in a cell. There is a need for programs which will devote a lot of time and effort to attempt to modify individuals' personality characteristics by increasing their self-control or enhance their feeling of empathy. Finally, rehabilitation does not ignore the rest of the community; on the contrary, it places a great value on changing the convict and preventing him from breaking the law again and again .
