Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
	If one characterizes this century as relying only on reason it is easy to extract imagination and the dreams from the centre and instead leave room for a different era that is the era of science, technology and industrialization which many people believe has deprived young people of any imagination and dreams. One is to believe that success is achieved through measuring the achievement in all the above spheres. However, it does not have to be so if one takes into consideration how these three spheres are interpersonally connected to imagination and dreams. This essay will further scrutinize how each three: science, technology and industrialization, are somewhere connected with imagination and dreams .
	If we take Imagination and science one can clearly see that they are seemingly unrelated. Imagination is taken as being the mere expression of a free thought whilst science is unyielding and rigorous. Science is bounded to fall within the understandable and reachable, in contrary imagination is without any boundaries. Both may seem completely different but what most people cannot see is that they are somewhat connected. One similarity that comes to mind is the balance between the two forces that are struggling tenaciously to achieve something of thought. There is a type of mutual relationship between these two opposites. Namely, science needs imagination to thrive, whilst imagination needs some sort of scientific support to function. If one takes scientists as being people strictly following rules and laws we must also engage with the thought that they also need imagination in the creative process. Also, imagists need to rely on science, if not they will fall in utter chaos. Consequently, imagination seems to be present even with parallel existence of science .
	The question we should be asking here is "what is technology without the imagination part?" What I am trying to imply here is that, technology is not just the invention of GPS, gadgets and telephones; it is the process that allows our imagination to transpire into the real world. An author enthusiastic about this theme holds that [Quotation] . To prove that, let me take you to Dick Tracy's cartoons where the wrist watch was also a walkie-talkie which has now become reality incorporated in our smart phones. It is a perfect example of imagination brought to the fore and creating something that we nowadays call a technology process. Take this citation for example [Quotation] . So to conclude, imagination is not lost here either, it is just how we perceive things .
	Industrialization can also be seen as interchangeable with imagination. If we take Slater's spinning machine which he produced from memory, the evidence is clear how imagination played a big role in this industrialization part. Another example are the railroads thanks to which transport of goods and people went swiftly and quickly. Let us take into consideration the imagination of an author such as Charles Dickens and his novel Hard Times. He put the question of industrial society as a subject to what might be entitled as the mobilization of imagination. Thus, proving once again how imagination can be put into practice to elaborate on the theme of industrialization .
	To conclude, science, technology and industrialization have all something in common. Namely, they all emerge from one single force that is our imagination. Maria Montessori stated that [Quotation] . In other words, imagination is the starting point which leads to scientific, technological and industrial breakthrough. Every dream is put into notion through imagination which final product depends on where that force is put into practice. Taking the three evolutionary components into consideration, we can clearly see that all are product of our imagination thus, imagination is not lost even long after the appearance of industry, science and technology .
