Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
When a person commits a crime, he or she should be punished for it. That is at least how most people feel. It seems morally right that the criminal should pay for his actions. Knowing that the criminal will go to prison, secluded from the rest of the world, his freedom and personal life being robbed from him, satisfies society. They get even with him. But does it benefit society in the long run?
Ideally, the criminal would come out of prison as a new and improved person. He will have had time to do some serious thinking about his life and his wrongdoings, and will have been determined to live a better life .
Of course, his is rarely the case. The prison often hardens the criminal, and once the person is free, he will most likely return to living the same lifestyle .
Although the prison has served as a punishment for the criminal, it has also wasted much of the taxpayer's money .
If on the other hand, the criminal goes through some sort of rehabilitation, it would profit both the criminal and the society, given that the criminal is going to be able to live a more productive life once he is free .
Obviously, if the criminal is suffering from a poor mental state, psychiatric help should be given. But at the same time many prisons today teaches the prisoners some type of skill, for instance activities like pottery making, but also different job skills. While it keeps the prisoners occupied when they are locked up, it is also a great help for them when they are released. It should be easier for them to function normally in society, and thus stay away from crime .
In my opinion, a criminal should be punished, as well as being rehabilitated. It is important to set an example to show that society does not tolerate criminal offenses. In addition serving as a punishment for the criminal, prison also keeps them away from society, out of harms way .
While rehabilitation of all criminals would benefit society, it is not realistic. Not every one wants to be helped, and not every one can be helped .
What prison should not be though, but often is today, is a school for the prisoners on how to be a better criminal. This only punishes society .
