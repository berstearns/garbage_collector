Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
There are almost 2 million Americans in prisons in the U.S. today. Many of these criminals go in and out of jail their whole life. Prisons are the perfect school for criminals. They can go in with a "Bachelor" degree in stealing cars, and then a few years later they can come out with a "Masters" degree in narcotic smuggling. The criminals often share information "in the joint" about what they know best, usually criminal stuff .
What can this world give the criminals in prison after they have served their time? It is hard to imagine how it must be. Serving years behind bars and then trying to blend in to our society. First of all, things change and the life they knew isn't the same any more after all those years. They have to adapt to "our new" world. This must be very difficult for them. Getting a job is important, but who wants an ex-criminal with a criminal record to work for them? If they fail getting a job, they often do what they know they do best, criminal stuff .
The prisons system should help the prisoners to get a new start in life. Help them with a college degree, or train them to be able to get some kind of a descent job after they are done serving there time. Let them work and feel that they are a part of something important and are needed in society. But most of all show them there is more to life than being a criminal. It is possible to make descent money doing "normal" stuff .
The most important issue to help prisoners with, that will later live in our community, is to help them understand that they cannot keep on disobeying the law. Everybody should be able to talk to a psychiatrist, or some person that will help him or her in his or her situation they now have to serve time in jail for .
Putting the prisoners "away" in jail cells will usually not help the prisoners, especially later on in life. After being stuck in a cell for many years, like an animal in a cage, away from any kind of freedom, the prisoners will probably have more problems when they get out, than when they where put in .
The jail system needs to be changed. For thousands of years we've locked criminals up in prisons. There have to be other solutions .
There is a reason why criminals get caught for something illegal again and again and are put back in jail. But why anyone would dare disobeying the law ever again after serving time in prison, is outrageous, but happens too often and shows that serving time in prison does not help nor change the prisoners lifestyle .
A descent job would definitely be a huge lift for them in changing their lifestyle. That is why they need help in prison, talk to psychiatrists or people who can help them and working so they can feel good about themselves and not wanting to go back to there old lifestyle as criminals .
All of these issues are depending on one thing. Money. The taxpayers are the ones who will suffer for all the "help" the criminals in prison will need. But thinking in longer terms, money will probably be saved because of less criminal activity .
