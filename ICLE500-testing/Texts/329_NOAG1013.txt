Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
In USA, Europe, Australia and in Scandinavian, in countries with developed western culture and thinking, woman have achieved a positition that gives her all basic rights as regards to education and study, religious performences and believes, to ways of living and to work and career. Even in some countries legislation gives her preferences to certain political and work positions and statuses just because she is woman .
Besides this achievements, the woman has gained understandness and respect from men, as this is what the women's fight concerns about-the liberation from men's suppression .
This long women struggle to achive equal possibillities in life and living, respect both being a woman and a person is long time ago fullfilled in the western culture. Their faight is over. The feminists work is succeeded and all men agree that they have done a most marvelous and highly nessessary work .
However, we have seen during the two last decades that feminists objectives have turned into extremeties. Equally rights and respect and possibillities are no longer enough. Feminists objectives are now to be superior to men - in all aspects and on all levels. And if they do not fine goals to fight for at home, they find abroad, but fight them from save positions from homeland .
Not long ago I read an interveiw with a nearly fourty year old woman. She worked ver hard and long and ahs given career first priority. However, she sais that he had a man who had given her a child and to whom she was married .
This way of perform life and living, to look upon man's role has become common and fully acceptable today. Man's role is being a fertilizer fullfilling woman's prestige to give birth and prove her womanhood .
More and more women seems to look upon men as a practical object, useful to have at hand when needed for different purposes .
Asking young women today what they features and characters they prefer with a future husbond, they will strongly underline that he must be rich in money, have a good job, a nice house and a fast car, and that he must be kind in the sence that he is very generous to her .
Hard values as money, status and position, etc are today dominent preferences to men .
Looking women today you will observe more and more confirmity with women. Personal identity and individuality are disappering. This confirmities you now can see in women's behavior, dressing, attitude, living and careers, and not least in their personal appearence. It seems to men, very unfortunately that to look like a manis most popular. Sometime even an experienced eye hardly catch the difference, if the person you look at is male or female .
Idealistic struggles when loosing objectives to fight for, too often turns into exstremeties, and so also with the western feminists fights. Objects become more peculiar, and it now seems that the main object is to be superior to men. And to have the slightest possibillities to gain an objective as this, to gain attentions and support, the feminists fighters must exaggerate, and exaggeration leads to vulgarity. Bad behavior and living, swearing, drunkness, drugs, etc, etc, what earlier were men's "exclusive privileges" are now fully atapded and accepted by women and seems now more common among women than men. To be bisexual and to perform bisexualities makes you a modern woman and gives you prestige .
From men's point of view the feminists have turned or transformed women into unpersonal objects. It seems to men that modern women are not allowed - or not so free - that she does not dare show that she is a woman, dare not show her femininity. Modern feminism has made femininity something shamefull. Even better under Talibanlike regimes - at least you know that under this dress is a woman .
Maybe men are too romantic. But for more and more western men, the modern feminist struggles and fights and influence on women seems to have killed feminism and where are the feminine women. This kind of feminist behavior and performance make men run away in distress and frustration. Modern feminism will turn back upon the women themselves, as the man will not allow feminists to disturb his nature born basic instincts .
More and more western men turns their back to their native women and look for partners and wifes in other cultures where preferences and values are others, where he feels cared for and where home, children and family still are dominating and most valuables factor for live and living. Or expressed by five men I happened to meet in an East European county's restaurant some years ago: -"We are looking for a feminine woman - feminist we have enough of at home."
