There is no doubt that most university degrees are theoretical. They do not prepare students for the real world and are therefore of very little value. Students that graduate have studied for many years, but they have never tried out their theories in the real world. Everybody can read a book on mathematics or biology, but do they learn how to use it in their future profession? Nobody can argue that there is a great difference from reading about something and do it for real. It is sad when one after five or six years of studying find out that one do not fit in the profession one was aiming at. It goes without saying that an education is an expensive investment in one's future. If one is unfortunate enough one have to start all over again to get a new education that fits. This could have been discovered much earlier .
A great many student with university degrees become teachers. During their studies they do not have the opportunity to find out if they fit as teacher. They do their reading, but they do not know what is the most important to learn or how they can teach it to their future pupils. If they had a chance to do it practically in their studies they would know more about teaching. One need exercise to become a skilful teacher .
It is obvious that some people are better theoretical than practical and vice versa. Some students may get the best marks in the university, but they do not know how to do a day's work. On the contrary there are students who are good at practical work, but not at theoretical studies that are found in the university. Is it fair that those who get a degree with excellent marks should get the jobs that the latter could have done better? I guess there are a good many employers that would choose those who know how to work in the real world, and do not only have the knowledge of different theories. I personally hope so. At secondary school most of the teachers have graduated from a university. They know a good deal about their own subject, but do not know how to teach it to their pupils. What is the use of such teachers? One has to think about those who suffer damage namely the pupils .
In spite of the examples above, quite a few people argue that university degrees are valuable. Even though some students do not manage to relate their studies to the real world, a great many of them do. A number of people also claim that one have to know the theory before one gets a job. Theory forms the basis of good work. That may be true, but why do they not include practical work in the degrees like they do in for example training colleges? Then there would be both the theoretical aspect and the practical aspect. But that is not how the university functions. People at the university have attached importance to the theoretical aspect for many years now and will doubtfully change that in the next couple of years. It has always been like that. Maybe the system would be changed if there were granted more money. Until then we will have to deal with the theoretical degrees and hope that the students manage to relate their studies to the real world .
As we have seen there is a disagreement between those who believe that the university degrees are of little value and those who think that they are valuable. Still nobody knows what the future will bring. One day there may be a change that will prepare the students for the real world .
