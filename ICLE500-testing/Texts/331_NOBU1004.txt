Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
When we look up in a dictionary the word "feminist" is described like this: a person fighting for equal rights among men and women. More than hundred years ago women in Norway really had no rights at all. They couldn't claim education. The most important issue was to learn sewing and cooking in waiting for a marriage. When married she had no rights either. She was her husband's property. We must thank God for what the feminist have done for us women. Today we take for granted woman's position in society. A lot of strong women have fougth for their rights but they had a long way to go and they met opposition among men. In 1882 the first woman obtained Examen Artium and in 1884 women could enter university. Women won the right to vote in 1913 but they had to be aged 30 not 20 as the men .
To a great extent feminist have been a benefit for women. But when women enter the labour market they tend to get employed as social workes. So what has happened is that instead of being at home taking care of children and elder parents they prefer to get a job and doing the same work in a kindergarten or at a old people's home. The difference is that they get paid and get sosialized. A man and a woman working e.g. in a kindergarten have equal pay, but because it's a typical woman profession the salary is lower than for example in the industry. Three years at college doesn't pay! At least women have got economical freedom, gained self-respect and are not dependent on any man. The last tendency is that young girls chose other education, they want to have a decent salary and not physically hard work. Who are going to do the social work? In the long run we have to import workers from foreign countries .
In recent years it has struck me that feminist have done some harm to their own sex. The hours spent with family and children are less. Bad conscience about work and children are
something many working women have to live with. I think that men and woman are not biologically equal. Women are born to take care of their children and men to go out and hunt.. No feminist can do anything about it. When parents come tired home from work there are still working hours left in the house. Of course many men do their share but statistically the woman do most of this job at home. Why? Are men lazy and women not angry enough?
Feminist have done us a disservice. We have never been more tired and exhausted than today. Maybe the housemother should be more acknowledged and better paid to the good of the family as a whole. When mothers are working the children have to be taken care of by others. They have to stay at school from early in the evening to late in the afternoon. That is a very long "working day" for a little child! The husband is also exhausted because nowadays he also have to do his duties at home which in earlier days was done by the wife. The parents have both got an extended working day because washing, ironing, meals to be prepared must be done in the evening and in weekends .
Many women find this hard to balance and have found a compromise solution; they work part-time. Women who can afford this when their children are small are usually very satisfied. They are able to spend much time with their little ones and fulfil themselves in a job, used their skill and meet other adults. Few mothers are at home nowadays so one can feel rather lonely working at home all the day. The streets are empty and no children are out playing. Most of them are in kindergarten and when they come home they are too tired to go out. The family has suffered as a cause of feminism and the divorce rate has increased. Today it's difficult to be a family in balance where everybody claim their rights .
