Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
At Oslo College we have had many different subjects during four years of study. In these subjects there have been many differences in how much we have learned about how to teach. In some subjects we have not learned anything about teaching methods, which should be very important for us .
During our education we have had several weeks of practice in compulsory schools, but I am not sure if this will make me a better teacher. We are usually four students together in the same class with the same teacher. Most of the time everybody is inside the classroom when we are teaching. This is a very awkward situation since you normally are by yourself and do not have anybody to help you. In this particular practise - situation you are able to give the pupils a lot of help, because we are five grown-ups inside the classroom. This makes the whole situation very unrealistic .
Another aspect is that normally the teachers chosen for this kind of job, have few problems with their pupils. Everything I have experienced is that the pupils are very well behaved. I have not had the opportunity to solve a huge problem, which I probably will meet as a teacher. So generally, I think the practice is too unrealistic .
But of course, we do learn a lot of being out in school as well. We do get to see how it actually is. You get an idea whether you suit as a teacher or not, and you can also get an idea about which age group you would like to teach. It is a long time since we were at a compulsory school as pupils. Therefore we can get to see the school in a different perspective. Even though, we probably do not see how it actually will turn out for us, we do get a pretty good idea about how it is to be a teacher. The workload, what kind of problems they have to put up with, everything they have to do apart from teaching etc .
Apart from our practice, I have already mentioned that there are differences between the different subjects at our college. Why I do not know, but I do find is as a problem. In my point of view we have to learn the basic in the most common subjects as Norwegian for instance. In those subjects we choose as main subjects we should know much more than the basics .
I have chosen English and Physical Education as my main subjects and in both of these subjects we learn a lot about teaching methods. Physical Education is especially good concerning teaching methods, because we actually have a lot of practise within the group .
Some of the subjects I have had before have not been that good. One example is Norwegian where we did not learn anything about how to teach, but a lot of theoretic stuff .
Another aspect about our subjects is that our exams are very often not related to teaching methods. Only in Physical Education we do have a practice exam where we are suppose to teach other students. It would have been much more realistic if we actually had to teach pupils .
Because of the theoretic exams, we are very concerned about learning the theoretic stuff. We are less concerned about learning the teaching methods, because we want be asked for it at an exam. Or actually, we have had questions about how to teach at some written exams, but nobody feels that this is the most important part of the exam. Usually, it is a quite small part. The teachers are also concerned about that we are going to learn the theoretic aspects before the exams. This is probably the reason we do not have more teaching methods inside our courses .
My opinion is that this is too bad, but I also think it is the reality. Because of this our college degree can be too theoretical. Our exam-results do not say much about how good we are in teaching, but it is also important to have a wide range of knowledge in the subjects you are suppose to teach. So I would say, our college degrees are valuable, but they do not say everything about our knowledge in teaching .
