Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
My father in law loves to discuss with me. And because I am a rather quiet and peace loving person he is the one who has to take the initiative - which he does as provocative as possible. It was about this time of the year (the end f February) that he once asked me: "My dear daughter in law, in what way will you contribute the eighth of March?"
He was probably looking forward to a juicy discussion, but I guess he asked the wrong person or maybe I could say he asked the wrong generation. The International Women's Day has occurred 32 times in my life but the thought of contributing in one way or another has never crossed my mind and I believe a lot of women in my age would say the same. Feminism is a non-existent topic but in the back of our minds we despise the feminists and call them names: Man-looking man-haters who threw their bras and forced abortion upon every woman .
On the other hand we take it for granted that our husbands cook, do the dishes and change diapers as much as we do. Are we ungrateful heiresses to what is gained throughout a century of "war"? Or have feminists done more harm than good to the cause of women? My answers will not be based upon research but simply upon my own observations and thoughts being a mother and wife - and obviously a woman .
Please your husband, take care of your children, and accept whatever comes; these were your only instructions and rights a hundred years ago. I think most Norwegian women are happy that they live today. Some of my girl friends are film directors, shop owners, designers, dancers, newspaper reporters, top athletes, musicians and doctors. Some are single mothers and own their own apartment. We have conquered every stage of society; the world is at our feet .
But the discontent always speaks out loud. Enough is never enough and it might seem pathetic that some feminists still are so extremely angry - because women aren't represented 50% in the best paid jobs, quota above qualification. I am sure I could point at several bad things that took place in the name of feminism. But this is where I think the feminist warriors have lost their way: in their eagerness to achieve equality they ignored to define what feminism truly is as a starting point .
We cannot deny the fact that we are women; nothing can change that (except an operation of course). Have we lost our feminine character? Oh, we are so fit and good looking and anorectic and dress like hookers but in an expensive way so as not to be mistaken for one, but do we feel female? Are we too hooked up in the money race that we don't recognise our own gender? We give birth to kids that we put in kindergarten, have full time jobs (or even more because carrier demands it) and someone (a woman?) to wash our big houses .
What are the female characteristics - things that men don't have? We do not dare to ask our men. That would be very degrading to admit our lack of knowledge and a huge step backwards. Why do "they" find the South European women so attractive? The modern super model carrier woman doesn't need a man except as a sex partner. She wants children but success is more important. She sees her children 30 tired hours a week while more than 40 hours a week she gives all her energy to the job. Making other priorities is a total failure .
We've become like our men, but as a result of this our men have become like us. Why do "we" find South European men so attractive? While we eagerly have struggled for our quotas, the enemy has become wife-ridden and henpecked. What a misunderstanding of female integrity!
However, a glimpse of a burka-wearing person in Yemen is enough to conclude that we are quite lucky to live in this "androgyny" society. Feminism has certainly contributed in making our world cynical and selfish, but in order to create change and revolution things needed to be stirred up, provoked and brought to the extreme edges .
The eighth of March is only one week from now. I won't be joining the demonstrators this year either .
