Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Mother and father are working and the child gets a key around his/her neck and comes home from school to an empty house. If you then ask this child "what do you do after school?", he/she would probably answer: "I watch television, play television games or computer games". Or say you go to a camp for children. There you would probably find that they actually don't have much imagination left! Without a television or television/computer games, some of the children actually don't know how to come up with something to do! Except for football maybe..
It's said about people in general that we watch far more television now than they did before. There are even many who are addicted. They sit in front of their television from they come home from work/school, till they go to bed in the evening. Why? Because there are so many good programs to watch? I don't think so..
I've read many times lately and heard/seen on television that people today are far more stressed at work, there are far more people who need help because they are depressed, there are far more people who long for an answer to the everlasting questions "why do we live?" and "what's coming after death?", etc. Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. You can also hear many who say that religion is just a "thing" we make up because we need something that can "take us away" from real life; something to comfort us when we are down or scared. If Marx was alive today in the 20th century, would he replace religion with television? If religion is just a "thing" we make up to get away from real life and Marx would replace opium with television, I'll ask another question: Why did/do people use opium? You should think it would be exactly to get away from life, to find comfort, etc. Has television replaced religion? Is this why people watch so much more television than before? They need to get away from the stressed everyday life, they are depressed, scared, etc? There are also far more programs on television concerning religion, science fiction, etc. Maybe people seek to find the answers to the two questions in television as well?
Television is a big part of most of our lives. We watch almost everything they send and we become affected by it. So, Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses and I should think that if he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he could actually replace religion with television. For some reason that "box" has a way of getting us attached to it and far too many of us watch programs that aren't good for us. In our century opium = television. Maybe we should open clinics for "Television-addicted"?
