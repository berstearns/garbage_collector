Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
We are now in the year 2002 and have entered the 21st century. It is perhaps time to think new ways when we talk about sentences, but where shall we draw the line? Shall we continue having prisons? Who will come under the criteria for rehabilitation and who should get a prison sentence? Is our prison system so outdated that we should abolish today system and close down the prisons and rehabilitate our criminals in other institutions? Which criteria should those new institutions have if these not should be a new type of prison? We certainly can't have a holiday resort for criminals!
Should we start with home sentences? In Sweden they are testing home punishment. There is the convicted person marked on either hand or foot with a sensor, a public attendant comes around daily to check the sensor. The sensor records every movement the convicted person makes and will tell if she/het has been outside the restricted area. This will save society money and it makes life better for the convict. How it functions and if the politicians and the legal system are satisfied with this new way of prosecution is unknown for me. I haven't seen any article or documentary about an evaluation of this way of paying your crime .
Should someone who has committed a murder be allowed to have a nicer way of doing his time than sitting locked up in a prison as they do today? How would society feel if those two young men who committed the terrible rap and murder of two small girls in Kristiansand where rehabilitated into society without been imprisoned? We are not ready to not prosecute our criminals and not put them into prison. Finding a solution to rehabilitate them is a good thought, but those who are touched by the criminals action want to see them punished as hard as possible. Society still demands punishment for crimes committed. Especially crimes which includes children or murder, people will not except any milder form for punishment than a long prison sentence or in sever cases death penalty . (I think of countries who have death penalties, like for example America and China)
I don't think that we can discuss our legal system and criticise it from the point of view of being a civilised society. If we were such an incredible civilised society why do we have criminals and why do we need sanctions for behaviour we dislike?
I know that one reason of becoming a criminal lies in the way we treat our children when they are small. Alcohol and drugs, unemployment and other factors can have much to say which direction your life will take. There are many children today who need extra care, something they don't receive. Some teachers see their extra needs and try to apply for extra resources during their education, but many don't get the help because of lack of money .
Many children experience that being a looser is humiliating and being good in something gives a good reputation. Playing tough, getting hold of things which others don't have when you are young gives in the beginning a good reputation, it often ends in bad circle, which is difficult to get out of .
Even if our technology is good, people still get disabled children or children with brain damage. Some of these brain disorders are not found and can later in life occur in a lifestyle and behaviour which society not appreciates .
I don't think that we ever will have a society without anyone behaving against what we accept. Believing in something like that, will be a utopia .
