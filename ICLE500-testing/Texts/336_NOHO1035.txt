Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Religion had, and still has, a great impact on our society. Religion was once part of a guidence which led to our Constitution in 1814. Still, today, the ten commandments are also seen in the Constitution as well .
Similarily, media, and especially television, is another arena in which different views are presented and popularised. Television is performing a kind of social control in keeping the masses ordered, just like religion once did. It generally act to reinforce values that are part of the whole society and plays an important role in the matter of forming new laws. The law concerning children-porn is just one example. If it wasn't for the media, this discussion might not have come up. Like religion, television affect how people think, believe and behave. Some might proclaim that this will destroy people's self awareness. But unlike from religion, people in today's society are rational beeings with the oppurtunity to choose. They can even choose not to have a telly in the house at all. That is the difference between television and religion. You can't choose religion. You are born into it. This is what really create conflicts, e.g schoolchildren shot on their way to school in because of their religion .
So the statement that television is the opium of the masses, connote negative reactions. We automatically think of the new television-culture nowadays; reality programs. Because of our quriosity which lies lateny in human nature, this sort of entertaining, will for a long period of time make the reader addicted .
In addition to pure entertaining, television contributes on other arenas as well. It's important to have access to information about real violence and sexuality in the world. Restricting such can be socially and politically repressive. Eg. The Vietnam War .
Religion gathered people. They went to church, they still do, and prayed together. They came to terms with their feelings and could escape from the real world within common surroundings. If we replace religion with television in the 20th century, we will witness the same thing. TV is both entertaining and reality. Still, it's an another world. We are consumers in a television-world so to speak. But as people were sceptic to religion in earlier days, the scepticism within television must not be unmentioned either. We have to remember that media in itself not only reflect events. They construct and change them as well. Television cannot mirror or reflect real-life situation innocently, since they become part of the events themselves. This is also a financial matter. Most producers know how to make the mass addicted. People's support concerning The Royal Wedding were among other events broadcastet all over the world. We could see how small children were dressed up with flags and tiaras. The Wedding produced some kind of emotional response in us. Weeks after, people were still talking about it. Some even recorded it . I think I'm addicted, a lady once said. She just had to watch it over and over again .
Religion bonded people together, television creates the same formula in todays' society. Over the years, TV has become a global village, were interactions and belonging are central elements. An escape from reality, but still give us insight of it, are reasons enough why television is opium for the masses. At least for most of them .
