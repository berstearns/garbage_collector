Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
I have a dream. These are the famous words of Martin Luther King Jr. I think a lot of people still have this dream. They dream of peace and harmony in the world. Not only peace between blacks and whites, but between all countries and races. If nobody had this dream what would the world look like? At the moment wars are going on in several countries. Some seem not to want peace, while others hope that one day all peoples will live as equals in harmony. This is probably the biggest dream of all and the most important one. However, smaller dreams are also important. And the road to peace starts with only two people becoming friends. It is a small step, but maybe the most important step on this road .
In everyday life we all have dreams. Some of us dream of a great job, winning the lottery, travelling to the other side of the world, or simply a happy family. A lot of these dreams never come true, as life is hard for most people. It is not easy to make it today, neither in the working situation nor in family life. Many have had their hopes crushed and stepped on several times. But usually they stand up and walk on. Their belief in their own dreams is what makes life worth living, and often a setback only strengthens their will to continue reaching for that dream .
Television, science technology and industrialisation have in some way replaced the need for using fantasy and imagination. Television gives us a picture of how things are, or rather how the media wants us to see things. Books give the readers an opportunity to imagine how the characters in the books look and act. This is an opportunity we even get from the radio. Cinematic versions of books give no room for imagination. In films everything is already decided for us. This is also the case in science documentaries. Everything is presented as a fact, and gives us no other choice but to accept this .
I think fantasy is a very important aspect of our life. We need to use our imagination to prevent our brains from decaying. When I was younger I loved to read books. I read at least a book a week and I had a great imagination. I enjoyed writing and I used a lot of fantasy in my stories. When I turned a bit older other things seemed more important than reading. And the only thing I read was my homework. Television more or less took over the books' role in my life. Lacking the books' influence my imagination suffered tremendously. I still enjoyed writing, but the use of fantasy almost disappeared. Recently I have regained my interest in books and I have already experienced that it has triggered my imagination. Hopefully I will continue to read books for the rest of my life .
I have dreams. I dream of an easier life, owning an apartment, becoming a millionaire, and maybe most of all I dream of love. I am a hopeless romantic. Even after getting my heart broken a thousand times I keep my faith in true love. That is one of the reasons why I get up in the morning. We all need to believe in our dreams. To me, that is what life is all about .
