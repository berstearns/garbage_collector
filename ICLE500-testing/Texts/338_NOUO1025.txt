Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
I believe that this statement is used, unfairly, by people who disapprove of the feminists' radicalness in different times. In their opinion, the feminists have, among other things, changed the old consept of family. For instance, a result of the feminist movement in the 1970s, is more divorces. Women can get out of marriages if they have been treated badly by their husband .
The suffragette movement wich started in the late 19th century, resulted in womens' right to vote in the early 20th century. Feminist have managed to change the way society look at women and the way women view themselves. A woman's reputation was earlier the most preassus thing she had. After "the sexual revolusion" one have acknoledged that women have needs the same way as men does. Women throughout the western world have got new opportunities and possibilities. They choose higher education, which lead to economic independence and more freedom for women in general. A concrete result of feminism in the 1970s is women's right to have an abortion .
Young women today cannot identify with the term "feminism". Even though many women feel that still, there are areas in which men and women are not eqal, they will not be indentified with the "un-feminin", angry women that "hated men". I think that is where the feminists in the 70s were wrong. They had to many rules according to how women should look and act. Today, girls and women do not feel at home in that discription. They are individualists. They want to be respected in the same way men are respected; like individualists. That is why a new feminist movement arose in the late 90s. They call themselves "the new-feminists" or the "Gucci-feminists. They feel that there are areas in wich they still have to fight. The issues are not as concrete as the ones that their mother-generation were fighting for. One example is domestic chores. Now that almost as many women as men have a job outside the home, women tend to be the ones who have to to all the work at home as well .
One negative effect of feminism which can be seen in this time, is the negative signals that espessially women give to other women if they choose to stay home, taking care of theur children instead of having a career. Women should be able to chose what they want to do without getting reactions that they are anti-feminsits .
In my opinion, feminism has not done much harm to women. The feminists have been radical in all decades and therefore thay have gotten a bad reputation. I believe though, that there has to be radicalism to create a norm. There are negative effects, but simply because there is still a long way before men and women are equal in all areas .
The fight for women's rights is really a fight for human rights. Women should have the same opporunities as men .
