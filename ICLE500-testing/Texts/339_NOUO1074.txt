Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Let us consider some of the reasons one might have for stating such a claim. It is true that universities offer highly theoretical education, e.i. lectures, and sometimes smaller groups. These lectures and groups come to maybe 10-15 hours a week. In addition it is required that students study on their own, e.i. that they read, read, read! Some students may form discussion groups, which is advisable, but none the less no more non theoretical than the other forms of education mentioned. The statement above, therefore, seems easy to agree with .
Is a university degree of less value than degrees from other educational institutions, like the norwegian høgskole? At høgskolen it is common to combine theoretical education, lectures, with a fair amount of practice at a relevant place of work. Students from høgskolen may thus be better prepared for "the real world". But I would argue that for a dedicated student it need not be a problem that the university degree is theoretical, they will most certainly adjust to the practical side of their studies once they start working .
One of the reasons most of the education at universities are purely theoretical may be that the students are free to choose their own combinations of subject to a much larger extent than at e.g. høgskolen. Because the combinations of subjects vary so much one would have to "tailor-make" some sort of practice for each student. And this is, of course, not an easy job .
It should be mentioned here that the degrees directed towards a particular occupation, e.g. the study of medicine or psychology, do in fact have plenty of practice .
One may conclude that a university-type education does not suit all students. It may be more valuable for well-disciplined students. Students who at own initiative seek out places they can practice what they are being taught. By e.g. taking side jobs or joining organizations related to their studies. There is also the possibility of taking one semester of your degree at a desired place of work. This is a fairly new arrangement that enables students to get a "real world" working experience. One should perhaps increase information about, and encourage the students to take better use of, the possibilities offered .
Students at universities are mostly left to themselves to decide how to study. With no obligatory lectures or homework it takes a lot of discipline to keep up the good work all through the semester. It may seem that this is because of the theoretical form of education, when it may be just lack of determination that leads to a degree of little value. The students need to realize that they must take an active part in forming their own education. I have myself studied at both university and høgskole and, seen from the perspective of me being prepared for the real world, I value my university education more .
