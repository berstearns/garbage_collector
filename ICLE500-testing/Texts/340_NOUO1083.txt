Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
This is a view of university education, that many people, righteous or not, tend to have. And most students have more than once questioned the value of sitting passively in the auditorium, listening to The Professor talking about something (almost) never mentioned outside the campus, only to procede to the reading room to sit there(passively?) for a couple of hours. The theoretical approach in University, can easily be seen as inadequate for coping with careers in the real world. This approach can be argued to be theoretical both in manner and content , that is the way it is taught and what is being taught.A student can stay quite anonymous if he/she wants to. There is no required attendance in smaller groups, so that working in groups can easily be avoided. The social abilities don't really have to be challenged. Another problem is the lack of focus on up-to date, concrete issues and problems, and of really facing and solving them. Maybe it can be called a kind of knowing what, but not how .
But the fact is luckily more nuanced than this. The value of any kind of education , in meeting the real world, depends upon what will be your occupation in it. It depends upon the student and his/hers abilities and efforts to extract the experience and learning actually present in the educational process. And of course, it's also important who the individual lecturers are, and what subject is being studied .
But, when it comes to questioning the value of a university degree, this will come more to its right if the focus is on the individual development: The (hoped for) wakening up of our consciousness, our curiosity, our critical abilities and not least the shapening of flexible minds. Through facing ancient questions, diving into the past to see the present, and reading the words of those who knew/know the art of conveying, we are hopefully at least given a stepping stone for our own individual development. And this will normally be tried out in the students own contributions through assignments. Also, whatever you study, you have to learn how to gain this knowledge, how to navigate in the mass of information surrounding you as a student. And this is not given you by spoonfulls, this has to be aquired through own effort, in the same way as later on in the real world .
There are for sure important qualities to gain from university studies. Still, are they sufficient and satisfactory, considering what they could have been, if providing a more practical and contemporary approach, along with the present inclination? No doubt, students would win a lot through a closer cooperation with both co-students and lecturers. Also, it would be valuable and inspiring going to other sources than mainly texts and other people's discoverings( which also now often is referred to as backgrounds, now "out of date").
Clearly changes for the better could be introduced in university education, to prepare students for their careers. But a crucial point has to be made about the nature of this type of education: Many of the students choosing it, do so presicely because it doesn't lead directly to any particular career. This is a fact effecting the type of education found in this institution. But even so, the need of flexibility does not require hours of one-way conversation in an auditorium as its method .
