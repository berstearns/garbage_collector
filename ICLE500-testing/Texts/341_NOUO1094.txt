Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
After reading the statement above I was puzzled as to how I would approach the problem and a little curious to know in what context that person uttered such a statement. My next problem concerned how I would analyze what s/he was referring to at the time .
When I looked up the word feminism in my dictionary I fond that feminism is "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of sexual equality". But the quation above does not refer to feminism per definition but to feminists, people who supposedly fight for feminism. Hence , I think the problem the person wants to address is what we in retrospect can see as a consequence of feminist "extemity", that culminated in the 1970s. At the late sixties and early seventies society in the western world seemed ready for an open discussion on the issue of women and their traditional roles as mother, wife and housekeeper. This was due to changes in the political climate and society as a whole. Women began to group themselves in organisations such as Women's Liberation. This happened especially in relation to the hippie movement and other young radical groups who were prominent in society and forced people to hear their message. The "extremism" of certain feminist organisations was only a necessary rebellion against what was felt as supression and degeneration of women that had been going on far too long. In my humble opinion, I believe this was an inevitablereaction to an existing androcentric world both in academic circles, the working place and the domestic sphere. Many women felt they were both marginalized and invisible as both subjects and objects, especially in academic studies. And they called for a feminist critical consciousness. In retrospect there has been a tendency to point to the reprocutions of the feminist movement. People claim it has broken up homes. They see the high divorce rate as a direct consequence of women's liberation. Also , the fact that women started to work outside the home and the children have been left in daycare are highly debated. Some members of society, expecially christian right oriented groups, blame women's liberation for legalising abortion, and see pro-choice activists as an abomination. The see women's lib. activities as devastating to the cause of women, since motherhood should be a woman's first priority. Other people praise feminists and feminism, asserting that without it women would still be unjustly reduced to an existence inside the home. In contemporary society, people seems tired of the whole subject matter of female versus male. There has been a shift in focuse away from women and on to gender, which concerns itself with man and woman in mutual interdependence. This is especially recognisable in academic studies. Contemporary women's studies does now presuppose a twentieth-century (twentyfirst - century) holistic anthropology. Here the human being is defined as sexually differentiated. It is not longer split into male or female body and a sexless, rational soul. Women studies make a clear distinction between sex as biologically determined and gender as culturally constructed .
The utterance "Feminists have done more harm than good to the cause of women" has very little ot no relevance at this time in history. It is a new millenium and people are generally no longer interested in the dichotomy women and men. We are all a human entity and the cause of women is outdated. We are now looking at the cause of mankind .
