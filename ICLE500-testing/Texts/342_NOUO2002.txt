Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
I think this is a very solid statement but for many of us, particularly in the western parts of the world, I belive that this statement is correct in many ways. I don't see the television as purely being a negative factor in the society today, and therefore I would like to point out some of the positive aspects that the television represents first .
One of the most important and significant role, the television has in the society today, is being an entertainer. Since the beginning of the early 1950's, the television set has been an entertainer in many households around the world. The television set has gathered families for a time of comfort and enjoyment. It has the ability to make people sit down and relax. I think that the second most important role that television has today is as being an important distributor of information and news. It provides us daily with updates on what has happened all over the world, whether it's politics, disturbances or wars in other countries. Tv programmes can also teach us about important events in history and geography. An because the television is a visual medium, it has the ability to take the viewer to historical places in our own armchair. It is also easily available .
I will now say something about the negative aspects of watching television. I think the television has the ability to passify the viewer to a big extent. It's a one way communication system. It may engage and excite, but the viewer can't immediately respond to the media for what he or she might disagree about on that particular subject or statement. It becomes too easy to take things for granted .
Addiction is another negative aspect. I think watching too much television can lead to a certain addiction. It's too easy and comfortable to sit and watch Tv game shows, sports; sit-coms or films. Unconsciously, you tend to spend several hours in front off the tv every day. You just have to watch the next football match or the next episode of. And before you know it, the whole evening is over .
I think being passive in front of the television set can also lead to a weight problem. You can gain weight when you're sitting quiet for several hours each day. And along with tv-watching, often comes eating as a part of the cosy time in front of the television set. You certainly don't burn a big ammount of calories by doing that .
Loneliness can also be a part of the reason why so many people depend on the telly. One certainly doesn't make any new acquaintances sitting at home. People of today should take more interest in getting to know the nature around them, joining a political organization og groups to meet people who might share the same interests. Having a few close friends helps, you to care about other people, and that might make you feel better about yourself as well. Making new acquaintances is not only good for for your social life, but it's also good for your physical and mental health .
I have now tried to point out a few positive and negative aspects on how the television affects the people in our society today. Some of the statements may seem very solid, but I belive that people should be conscious about their relationship with the television, and know when to turn the televisionset off. The television is here to stay, and like I said earlier it is an important distributor of news. I only wonder what Marx's opinion on the subject would be .
