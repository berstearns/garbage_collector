Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The claim that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination because our modern world is dominated by science, technology and industrialisation is, in my opinion, downright stupid. I also think that such a claim reveals a sense of nostalgia I think has little or no relevance to the genres, or professions if you like, which best express contemporary thought and ideas, namely literature, music and arts. In this essay I will try to elaborate on a few point in order to explain my view .
Frankly, I find the claim hard to grasp. Do humans dream less because of the invention of the microchip? Has our imagination diminished because we can now read books on the Internet? I think the claim could be narrowed down to "evolution kills imagination". Considering that humans still possess imagination, I feel tempted to point out the obvious: Human culture has evolved since the beginning. When did science and technology stop us from dreaming? Was it the invention of the lightbulb that killed our imagination? Rhetorical questions aside, here is my point: When one speaks of dreaming and imagination, then this nostalgia, this longing for the past, should be seen as much more dangerous than science and imagination. These are all traits that go hand in hand, and they are distinctly human. In fact, a modern world dominated by science and machines gives way to new dreams and new ways of thinking. Science fiction can be seen as an example of this, and so can electronic music. I have the feeling that someone capable of declaring that science and technology leaves no space for imagination, might not be the biggest Sci-fi nut .
Modern techniques such as photo rendering and computer graphics are new tools available to the modern artist. Sampling and the use of computers have become essentials in creating various forms of modern music, and writers of all kinds now use word processing. Modern technology can not only be a tool easing the creative prosess, it can also make new forms of creativity possible. Some critics argue that the use of modern tools such as computers often results in inferior quality. To that I can only say that the artist has the sole responsibility. It should be fairly obvious that the choice of tools directly influences the creative process. Some even argue that musicians should not need to go to school to develop a high level of proficiency on their instruments. They fear that schooling takes away the individual character of an up-and-coming musician. In response to such fears I quote the renowned guitarist Bill Frisell: "It's only the players' fault if they let themselves be programmed by the routines that these places establish." He continues: "For example, in the harmony classes at Berklee, they'd have ' avoid notes', notes you weren't supposed to use over a particular chord. Naturally, those were the first ones I'd check out." (Guitar Player, July 1992) I think the combined output of all contemporary artistic activity is a clear indicator of the state of mankind. Many argue that this is precisely the job of an artist; to mirror contemporary ideas and thoughts in all its shapes .
Industrialisation and new technology inevitably shapes our daily life and the world around us, hence it also influences the way we think and the way we dream. Invention and progress should be seen as assets, not burdens, of living in modern times. I think a key point in this discussion is whether the comforts of modern life, with all its impressive gadgets and its focus on effectiveness, leaves us with more spare time to dream or not. I believe that is often the case, and if not, one should reconsider the ways in which the fruits of modern times are employed. The responsibility of an action is that of the performer, not the tool. Thanks to word processing, I have been able to spend more time elaborating on this essay than actually writing it .
