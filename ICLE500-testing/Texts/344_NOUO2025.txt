Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Is there a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world, dominated by science, technology, and industrialisation?
In the dictionary it says that the word "dream" means "an ambition or an ideal"
If we were to use this as a definition of what dreaming is, my immediate answer would be "yeas!"
This because, I think, in most of the western societies people feel as they don't have much more left to fight for. We get the feeling that technology and science will take care of all "visible" problems, such as health problems, environmental problems, etc. Industrialism has developed a strong economy in most of these countries, and the young people growing up today, were born into a wealthy family. Most of what is to fight for, are issues that has already been taken care of by previous generations .
If you ask some of the teenagers who are taking drugs today, why they do it, their answer is often "I'm board". There exist, I think a feeling of emptiness among many people. Almost every thing is for free, so to speak. This emptiness can lead to destructive drug use, but also for some people a search for something more spiritual, and new ideas of what things in life that is most valuable. This is what makes us continue to dream, and there for my answer to the question is also "no". We are travelling more now than ever before, we are interested in unknown cultures, in new ways of looking at life. Being a Buddhist is hip. People also mix different ideas from several religions. Some call it "Shopping religion".
What about using imagination? Even though our society has been dominated by industrialisation, science, and technology for quit some time now, there still exist a lot of creativity. The 20th century brought new ways of making art, music and literature .
Young people today, who grew up with computer games, and MTV, being used to entertainment almost every minute of the day, are just as much creative human beings as generations before. If not, there wouldn't have been so many new artists, writers, painters etc. A need of a room for using imagination makes people trying to find one .
My conclusion is that a society dominated by science, technology and industrialisation is not enough for most of us. In the 20th century human beings has in many ways desperately been trying to find their spirit. This shows in arts, filmmaking, literature as Modernism, and in new philosophies, such as Existentialism. The war protests, the civil writes demonstrations, and Flower Power in the 60's, was a result of people dreaming of change .
Good material conditions do not necessary mean happiness, a society that includes everyone and spiritual satisfaction, it does not makes us stop dreaming, it encourage us to dream even more. Sadly many people does not know any better than to by a dream as in a new car or replacing spiritualism with drugs. But still I believe that dreaming and using our imagination is one of the things that make us human, and the most of us will continue the never ending searching for the "new".
