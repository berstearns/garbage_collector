Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Countries around the world have different prison systems. Some countries practise death penalty, whaile others let their criminals stay in jail. No mather what kind of a prison system a country has, the criminals get punished. Instead of rehabilitate the criminals by sending them to teraphy, the system lets the criminals suffer, either by being alone or by getting tortured .
I will first present the countries that do not practise death penalty, and then i will talk about death penalty. The essay will end with a discussion about what kind of prison system that will work the best, and how to renew the system .
Most countries do not practise death penalty, among these countries Norway is included. In these countries the criminals either get placed in prison or they have to do community service, it depend on the crime. After being caught by the police, the criminal is brought to trial. In trial the judge decides the extent of the crime, then the judge gets the criminal sentenced for the crime he or she has committed .
Let us use Norway as an example of a country that doesnt practise death penalty. In some cases the criminal only have to pay a fine. This is often in connection with for instance exceeding the speed limit, In other cases the criminals are sent to prison where its possible to stay for 21 years .
In the prisons there are a clear distinction on how the criminals are treated, and this depends on whether the crime is serious or not. But in all cases the criminals get placed in a cell. By being in a cell the criminals get little contact with the outside world. Some criminals nearly get anyone to talk to at all. A person who has committed a serious crime as for instance a murder is an unstable and sick person. We live in a society were everybody have the right to be treated equal, this also includes the criminals. A criminal should, like any other sick person, has the opportunity to talk to somebody about his og her problem .
Instead of letting the criminals stay in jail, some countries practise death penalty. Death penalty is mostly used in some states in the USA. When a criminal gets sentenced to death, he or she must have done a serious crime like a murder. A person who has killed another human being does not deserve to live, is the philosophy behind the death penalty. This is the same philosophy people used thousands of years ago, when "an eye for an eye" was the rule to follow .
The headline of this essay claims that today's prison system is outdated. I absolutely agree with that. Criminals who sit for many years in a cell with no one to talk to have probably not become better persons. If a criminal just sits day out and day in in a prison, he or she is probably filled with anger and revange against society. When the criminal has served the sentenced without being helped, I think its difficult for he or she to live a normal life as a decent citizen. If criminals are going to manage to live a normal life, i think they need to attend teraphy, The criminals can perhaps find out why the crime was committet when talkin to a psychologist and improve .
When it comes to death penalty, i do not think any countries should be allowed to use this kind of punishment. It makesthe State as bad as the criminal. Its the relatives of the criminals who will suffer. The criminals are executed and can no longer be hurted. By practising death penalty people should fear doing crimes, but in the countries that practise it the number of crimes hasnt decreased .
Its difficult to find a solution on how a prison system should work proporly. Some people mean its a waste of money to help the criminals with teraphy, while other people mean that a criminal should be treated equal with any other person. The most imported thing is how to increase the number of criminals without breaking the human rights .
