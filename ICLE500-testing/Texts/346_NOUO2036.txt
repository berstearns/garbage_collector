Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Marx once said that religion was the opium for the masses, and first and foremost this slogan (if you can call it a slogan) was his explanation of the negative effects of religion. Firstly, as he claimed, it dulls your mind, your intellect and your ability to think clearly and independently. Secondly it has, in conformity with the opium, the ability of making people addicted of the "substance", and by this it keeps people in check and controls their life pattern. In other words it makes them to follow traditions and practise rituals for someone or something they believe in, or, as he would probably have said it, do something totally meaningless and even do it regularly. But he found also a positive side of religion; namely that one of its effects is that it diverts "the masses's" attention from a potential revolt against the communistic state .
It's an interesting thought; would Marx have replaced religion with television, if he had lived today? My answer to this is both yes and no. The answer depends on what kind of position or role he eventually would have had in our society. My answer would be yes if he was in opposition to the governing party and this party would be less communistic in their policy than he himself would have been in the same position. Then it would not have been unlikely to believe that he boldly would have claimed that "Television is the opium for the masses". But on the contrary, if he himself was the head of state and was running the show, then I think he would have seen television as an excellent instrument to indoctrinate the masses with communistic propaganda. Of course he would have used other words and maybe said something like: "...educating ever individual in the society to be a good citizens of the communistic society...etc.", and maybe continued that "...this is now possible with these inestimable instruments (TV and likely also internet) that the unconquerable intellect of mankind has given birth to...". There is a proverb that say that power makes corrupt, and regarding the historical examples of communism (and to some extent socialism) and what the consequences of these regimes have been, I think that these three words (power makes corrupt) describe, as briefly as it is possible, but very strikingly what have happen in the communistic states .
Now whether television is an "opium to the masses" independent of what Marx would have said if he would have been alive today, is also a very interesting question to ask. My personal opinion is that television has unfortunately become the opium for a great "mass" of the population. It's far from uncommon that people today are watching television at least more than hour each day, and in many families the TV has become the heart of the house (or the flat), the great rendezvous in the family .
The reason why I think one can say that it is an "opium for the masses" is that it simply makes you very passive and it teaches you to develop a spectator's attitude towards life. I also think it more or less creates an illusion of an artificial world, and therefore can dull your capability to read and understand different signals coming from the real world. I also think that especially children and teenagers are strongly influenced by television. But the most negative aspect of this is that television itself is more and more influenced by money and power. For some peopel I think you can even say that watching television has become their relgion .
My final comment about Marx is that I in fact agree with him. It may sound like a paradox, but I agree with him even though I call myself a christian and strongly believe that God exists. The reason why this is not a paradox for me is because the word "religion" to me means trying to do as best as you can to please God. And perhaps then God will be satisfied. But to believe in God is the most natural thing to do, and since I know that he is already satisfied with me through what Jesus has done on the cross, and there I don't need to strive for Gods acceptance. To me God is life, and to believe in him is to live in a fellowship with him, but it's definitely not about religion and neither an opium .
