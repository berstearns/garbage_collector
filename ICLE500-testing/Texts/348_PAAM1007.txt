Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Crime is an act committed by somebody which is against the laws of a society and harmful for the people of the society. Whenever somebody committs a crime, he is supposed to be guilty and is supposed to be punished for his act, so that he and the other members of the society learn the lesson from his punishment. Now, it is the duty of the law enforcing agencies and the members of the civil society to make a code of conduct which should be applied to each and every member of the society . 
There are different code of conducts and different punishment procedures in different societies. For example, the punishment for theft is different in different societies. Prison is the place where the criminals are detained to segregate them from the rest of the people so that they may not cause harm to the members of the society and the members of the society may live in a peaceful way. So prison is a place where criminals are kept. It is a place where criminals are kept as a result of their guilt for a period of time sufficient enough to make them clear of the guilt. So prison is a place which plays very important role in the later life of a criminal when he is released from the prison. During his stay in the prison he has to live with the other criminals who are detained for different crimes some more severe some of moderate intensity, so a criminal lives in a sort of school or a hostel or home where he lives and interacts with other people. It makes the prison a society . 
There are children who are detained for their guilt e.g. pick pocketing, there are persons who are detained for major wrong doings e.g a theft or a murder but as they live together in prison they interact with each other so they have a chance to learn from each other and from the environment of the prison. In most of the civilized societies the prisons are thought to be an important place and are given good importance to make them a proper learning place and beneficial for the criminals. They are given psychological consultations to help them resolve their mental sickness. They are taught different subjects which help them in their later life to make them good citizens. Prisons are made a good vocational institutes where criminals learn alot. In third world countries, and poor countries like Pakistan, prisons are still a place which needs a lot of reforms . 
Rather than turning a guilty person or criminal into a good citizen, the environment of prison makes these prisons more harmful for the society. In their after release life they become more dangerous of the rest of the society members or they learn alot more ways to commit crimes and cause harm to the society. So in our poor country like Pakistan prisons should be given top priority for the better education of the criminals so that when they are released they should prove a helping hand for the society.
