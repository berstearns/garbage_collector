Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 

The degrees are need of time. A man cannot be considered literate or educated without a valid and authorised degree. For survival and better future these named degrees are more important and essentially necessary. This is demand of the day. People are running after there degrees blindly to get them without bothering whether they are getting knowledge of that degree's worth. Their sole purpose is to get the degree by hook or by crook. So is the purpose of the well-known universities. They issue the degree to the students who learn the books by heart or crame them without understanding. On the part of students university requires bookish knowledge. They believe in printed material not in creativity. Many examples can be cited here to prove the point that theory is more important than the creativity. The same pattern is followed by the reknown universities. Individual thinking is always suppressed. The students who violates the traditional way of learning have to pay for that valient or bold act. Because university would not issue degrees to the students who tried to become smart. To some extent the authority is right because some times students failed to clear his points, to convey his mindset. But the examiner must try to read between the lines to understand the viewpoint of the students. The examining authorities give a very little chance to the students to present their own experience and personal thinking. Because the individual thinking seems to be in convenient to them. There are many successful people who have attained a valuable status in the society without having these mere named degrees. Many literary personalities and even writers are thought to illiterate. So it is an open prove that without degree a capable man can prove himself .
The famous proverb that Man learns from his own experience is a vital and athentic logical prove that degree are mere theoretical proves not prepare the people for the real world which is very tough. No doubt that we learn from books a lot but they did not tell us that we are gong in a wrong direction. The will not come to stop us from mischives acts. So the importance of books is doubtless but we should not negate creativity. We should take guidance from books but must use that enlightenment according to the circumstances and situations .
There are many example to prove that universities donot prepare their students for real world or it would be better to say for the practical world. Because you have to show your abilities through your attitude, body language, way of talking, living and behaviour. And there are many well educated people who have more than one degrees in their hands but they cannot convey their message convincingly, they donot have the personality to effect others lives. Whereas it is considered that a well-educated man is role model for the coming generations. If man with a degree have complexes in his personality how can he impress others?
Another kind of educated people is that they don't have command over their subject. Whenever they discuss something related to their subject they get confused or sometimes they donot have enough arguments to defened themselves. A simple example is that a man who have been awarded with the degree of masters in English do not know the structure of a sentence. He cannot write simple english. He cannot teach his subject. He is very weak grammatically. The who will accept him in practical world? What his degree can do for him? The only way is that he should try to improve himself . 
To sum up it could be said that though the university degrees are theoratical but they are as necessary for survival as basic needs like food, air and water. A man who have a worth-while degree would be more confidents then a man without degrees. A degree is also prove of your hardwork. In the practical work preference is given to these degrees. But there should be some space for the students who have the calibre of creativity must be appreciated. Because such kind of thinking can bring a positive change in life.
