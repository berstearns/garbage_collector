Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Although this is a general discussion about the prison system but I am talking about the prison system in Pakistan. The prison system in Pakistan is really out dated. It is centuries old that was designed by the British against the Indians and the Muslims. Almost all the systems in Pakistan are those which were made by the British to humiliate and dominate the people of sub continent. In Pakistan this system of prison is centuries old and too bad. Rather it has reached to the level of worst. As police is associated with the prison system and the law and order system, so the corruption is at its highest level in these departments. So the prison system is also not free of this curse. The bribery is very much common is there in the prisons. The officials in prisons openly take bribe for various purposes. Even inside the prisons the drugs and arms can be found easily. There are officials involved in all these games. The prisoners are dealt with very bad methods. They are brutally tortured and there are different methods to be used to torture them. Mostly the criminals become more criminals when they leave jails and prisons. All this is because the prisoners are not treated as human beings. Rather they are taken as animals and non humans. The brutal torture and the company of further criminals make them rather big criminals. Even the facilities for prisoners are not good in prisons. The food the prisoners are given is usually substandard. The other facilities are also too poor and not up to the mark. The proper way to treat criminals is not to punish them severely. There may be other ways to treat the criminals. They should be rehabilitated. The system does not say to hate the criminals. But it says to hate the crimes. So the criminals should not be hated. Rather they should be given more care and attention so that they are not doing the crimes next time. This approach would give very much positive results and the crime rate may be reduced. D be some vocational trainings and courses in the prisons where the prisoner should be given chances to learn various things so that they may be able to do something when they leave prison. Similarly, there should be some psychologists in the prisons where the psychotherapy of the criminals should be done so that next time they don't commit the same crimes. The counseling may be the best option for them. There should be some system to educate the prisoners and criminals. The religious education should also be given along with the other education. The religious touch may prove more helpful to them to regain a normal life. The young criminals should must be kept separate from the professional and habitual criminals. Such criminals always mar the character of those young ones and take them towards the way of severe crimes. Similarly, the reasons for the crimes must be probed. The petty and minor issues must not be punished severely as it creates bad image on the minds of the youth and they become more accustomed to the crimes at larger level. No civilized society is in favor of punishing the criminals. Rather they prefer the system of rehabilitation. It is the rehabilitation which may help reducing the crime rate in any country.
