Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

This is a strange comment that in our this modern world which is called global village, and which is dominated by science and technology in all the fields of life, there is no longer a place of dreaming and imagination. Some of the people may agree while some may disagree. Every body has his own point of view. One is thing is evidence that the world has become a global village. And in this global village the science and technology has reached to a very much highest level. Man can not imagine the level where the science has reached. It has reached to a very high climax. Even the science has made true all the dreams of the man that were once only considered dreams. Now all dreams have come true and all imaginations has turned into realities. Once man dreamed to fly in the air and now the aeroplanes have made this dream come true and now man is flying in the air round the clock as much high as much he wants to fly. Once it was a dream to see the man from distance and to hear the other man from distance. But now the mobile phones and televisions have made this dream come true and real. Now the distance is no more a hurdle in the communication. Now man can easily talk to his friends or relatives who are thousand miles away from him on the other side of the globe. Now a few clicks of the buttons bring you in contact with some one who is millions of miles away from you, and you all do it without any wires, without any cables or without any physical link. It shows that how the modern man and the modern world has made progress. It shows that in the global village nothing is impossible. Rather all is possible. And no wish can be left unfulfilled . 
But imagination and dreaming is an important part and parcel of human nature. Man can not live without dreams and imagination. It is the quality of human beings that he dreams of many things. He dreams of things he wants to achieve and he dreams of the things he doest not achieve or he failed to achieve. The dreams and imagination takes him to another world of escapism where he takes refuge in the laps of fascination. The dreaming and imagination are important part of life and they help a lot to spend a normal life on the earth. And other than the escapism, there is another factor which is proof that the imagination and dreaming are necessary for the life. For all major inventions the man first dreamed and then he started working on the dreams and imaginations to make it realize the true. In other words one can say that it was the dreaming and fascination and imagination that lead the man to the path of so many marvellous inventions of age. The flying was a dream of man since so long which came true with the passage of time. So if the process of dreaming is stopped, if it is excluded from the world, there would be no proper life . 
The modern man is too much occupied in the rat race of materialism. The lust for money is too strong in him. All the time man is busy in collecting the wealth and money. He is too much preoccupied in the pursuits of collecting money. So in such a case the man some times take help from his imagination and he falls deep in to the valley of imaginative things which give him relaxation for some time. In this way it is the imagination which helps the modern man to find some moments of relaxation, peace, calm and satisfaction. Similarly, the literature is most of the time based or depending on the imagination. So it is crystal clear that imagination and fascination and dreaming can not be left. One type of dreaming is day dreaming. This is the thing which could not be allowed there in the modern world or one may say that this is the thing which has no place in the modern era. In this age perhaps the day dreaming has room to exist, other wise the dreaming and imagination are still there and their presence can not be ruled out from the modern world.
