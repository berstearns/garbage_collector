Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. Universities are the source of higher education for the people. The university graduates are successful in finding the good jobs at good salarys and higher payments. The higher education is paly a very important role in the life of the students. They get higher qualification for the sake of good jobs. But now a days almost every university and each college is distributing degrees for the sake of money. There is no proper base for the knowledge and understanding. The students have the bookish knowledge but no proper understanding of the subject or the material. Such students are very good in the exams and they get very high marks in their exams but when they are go in the practical life, they find it totally impossible for themself to prove their knowledge. They are unable to do the things practically. They are just the book readers and crammers. They cram the things just for the sake of the passing of the examination but they do not have practical understanding of the things. This case is especially in those professional degrees where a lot of practice is required. What is the use of such a person who is only the bookish knowledge of the things and he is unable to do any thing practically and does not shows any field work. There are many reasons for this problem. The major problem regarding this problem is that the students are not serious. They do not pay proper attention to the studies. They do not seek any good work and guidence in the practical side. Their main aim is not the practical life but they only wanted to pass the examination for the purpose of degree. Some of the students are not interested in the studies. They only come to the universities for the purpose of the time pass. They come their, spend their times in canteens, cafeterias, benches and class rooms, talk to their friends and then go away. Such students get pass marks as the semester system is easy to pass. But when they come to practical life, and when they come to the market for the sake of job, then they come to know that they do not have any practical understanding of the degree. Such situation gives a disgrace and bad repute to the name of the degree and the institution. Some times there is an other major reasons for this thing. That the universities are not interested in proper teaching and practical aspect of the subject. They only charge the fee and then get the students admitted in the universities and then pass on and left. They want to save their funds and resources so they do not give much importance to the practical aspect of the subject. In this ways the students remain weak and they do not have some proper practical understanding or the knowledge of the subject. Such students not only fail in the jobs but they also fail in the practical life also. This situation does not produce the proper and responsible citizens but the lame and crippled people who are useless and just a burden on the face of the country.
