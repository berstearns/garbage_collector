"Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television." By this statement we are informed with Marx's views about religion. Marx was the father of modern communism. He was born in 1818. In his intial age, he was jew by religion. Later on, he turned his views to materialism. He presented his political and economic philosophy of class struggle envisaging replacement of capitalism with socialism . 
His communist views caused of dialectical materialism. According to his theory the course of history is the evalutionary development of the conflict between opposites. It considers the present day condition of the world as the result of a class struggle between the capitalists aiming at private profit and the proletariat who do or should resist exploitation at their hands . 
Being a man of materialism, he is adverse to religion. According to him, religion has no importance in making a man's life happy and successful, it is rationalism may lead a man on a successful way. But fact is not that. He is quite false in his views. All his arguments about religion are based on prejudice. He prefers materialism to religion inspit of its all defects. It is materialism which has snobed the moral values of man. Man has fallen down from animal level. It is only for the reason, that he has been free from religion. It has resulted into rising corruption and other social evils in society. In this regard the instense of Japan can be given which is the biggest economic power of the world but is at the first number committing suicede. The people of the countries where religion is an unnecessary mater, has deprived of inner peace and smooth . 
Religion is the intuitive voice of man. If body of man is needed for food, the soul of man is also needed for the acts of virtue. Otherwise there is not any difference between human and animal. Even the cave man was a religious one. He also worship his own god. The history of religion on the earth as old as man. A person who believes in God never be disappointed. He fixes his eyes to the God in every situation. This thing produces in him optimism. Contrary to it, materialistic person is pessimistic. It may consider the religion responsible for strife in the world, because many fights are fought in the world on religious views. He also may consider that religion brings many restrictions in its wake in man's freedom. But we can not accuse the religion a cause of strife in the world because if we know without prejudice we shall come to know that every religion preach its followers to live peace and tolerance. It is human nature which urges him to dominate the other nations . 
In short, like Carl Marx any thinkers have presented their views against religion and have attempted to slip out the image of God form massess's mind but inspite of all, they failed bitterly in their purpose. Because the God such a reality which is the voice of man's soul. Even a materialistic is not fully convinced of denial the God.
