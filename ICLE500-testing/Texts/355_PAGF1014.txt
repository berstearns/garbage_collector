Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
I totally go against the above given statement that dreaming and imagination is minimized in modern and advanced technological world of today. Rather according to my opinion, imagination and dreaming has got broad canvass and vision due to numerous 
availability of sources and information. I would like to start my argument with the mostly hold opinion of people about dreaming and imagination that is with the advancement of machinery, scientific researches, the passion of love is reduced to none. That is altogether wrong family is basic unit of society, family ties are there. The natural instinct of human being to love and to be loved is there. What so ever advancement man is doing, where so ever he is reaching, the need of love, sympathy, gernerousity, feelings leads towards dreaming and imagination. Dreams for a better, peaceful, smooth family or social life is there with man and it can never change .
All the advancements are bringing change in his living standards. Man has got luxurious and facilities life to live and enjoy. But we should not forget here to mention that all these progresses are actually the result of dreaming and imagination alongwith hard work and experinents to improve the standards of life. Another angle of that can be taken or interpreted for this statement is that of time consumption. It is said that people are much occupied with scientific facts and technological achievements that he is never free for dreams. They said that dreams are needed if one is unable to get what one wants. If everything is available, everything is on finger touch, then there does seem any place for imagination. But the things that are available on finger touch are not all life .
These are an important aspect of life, not all life can be spent depending on these things. If one makes the use of technology excessively in one's life, there surely comes a time when his/her nerves get faliqued and one needs that imaginative part of one's life back .
Dreaming and imagination is essential human activity which controls him from becoming mechenical brutal and inhumar. Being mechanical can not support a man to fit in society, neither it helps a man to live healthily and happily. Dreaming points to future, which imagination points to both past and future. Man tried his level best to do his best to get best in life. Along with doing best, he keeps on dreaming for more and more to compete and beat others for making his life superior but there comes a moment when he imagins his past when he started struggle then he sees his future to be more bright and envious for others. He wishes his family, country to be more successful and excel in every walk of life. He dreams to get fame in case of success. So it is proved that scientific achievement in shape of technological advancement is not all for satisfaction of man, dreaming is has the half share with these things Dreaming and imagination is a kind of Recluse for relaxation from all mental and physical effort. It is actually a key to the physical achievement. One dreams of some thing and then one uses ones mind to make that thought a reality. The same is case with imagination. One imagines something better to accur in life and tries that imagination be reality. We can see the collapse of many societies, who eradicate these things for their life and the result was collapse of society and a robote like life. So it create a balance in society, both things need to walk side byside .
Dreaming is innate in man which can never be irradicated, neither there modern era is able to caste off there things from life. It is there and it will remain forever after as well as imagination.
