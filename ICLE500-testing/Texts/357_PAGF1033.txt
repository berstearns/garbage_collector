Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
No civilized society punish its criminals, it should re-habilitate them . [Quotation] . [Reference] 
Crime exists in the world since the very existence of the human beings in the world. When we turn over the pages of the book of the history, we may see that every society and civilization set some code of conduct to be adopted to encourage peace and order in the community and also fixed some to punishments to discourage the nefarious designs of criminals.1$	In the very beginning of man's appearance, there was not even any criterion to judge the right & wrong. This was worst period of lawlessness and chaos. During the past few decades, every society is focussing upon the maintenance of peace & serenity in its community. Any person who tries to violats the law, is put behind the bars for a specific period as punishment for his/her misdeeds. There is apparently no fault in putting the criminal behind the bars, but the question when happens to the criminals behind the bars might have a pinching effect on any soft hearted person. Most of the criminals are treated as feelingless animals behind the bars. We come across many stories of the criminals tortured to death while they are in prison. Those, who are tortured to death, might be at a benefit compared to those who are worse them dead. This is a fall of the brutality of the custodians of law enforcement. There is still an other sad and gloomy picture behind the bars which is even worse them the physical torture . 
The criminal who are influential and have access to the government machinary enjoy every facility and even mentally torture the criminals belonging out of the prison as civilized people, Most of the criminals are stubbed with malice, prejudice & hatred against the society for the injustice, cruelty and rough treatment given to them without any justification . 
So far as the human nature is concern, a man is basicly thirsty for love & affection. You can get far better and positive result if you use delicate and sophisticated stick of love, co-operation courtesy for the criminals instead of being cruel for the rectification of criminals .
Human prejudice and malice also aggravate the already infuriated criminals. Some times a criminal, after spending the strenuous & never breaking period of misery comes out of the prison with a positive intention to lead a civilized and well mannered citizen of the society. But when he has to be a social outcaste faces the hatred and prejudice of his own family and friends, relatives and the members of society, he has to change his intentions and emerges out even more dangerous criminal . 1$	If a society really wants to rectify its criminals, it should try to be tolera itself first. There must be rehabilitation centre for the out cast criminals and for those who are homeless . 
The community should provide respectable means of earning to these criminals. So far as the prison atmosphere is concerned, It must be revolutionized as as well the law enforcing authorities should shoulder their responsibilities and arrange for the conduction of moral classes. Religious scholars may also play their role in turning the heads of rebels. The importance of patience, tolerance, contentment & simplicity in life must be emphasized. The police should not treat the criminals like animals. They should be told what an asset they might be to themselves, their family and to their nation, if they focuss on the point to get progress in life . 
Crime in every society is viewed as having a devastating impect on social economic and political life. Every one of us in concerned about becoming the victom of violent property or moral crime. Legal remedies coupled with modified individuals behaviour can limit the risk of victimization. Business crimes, serial killings, teenage gangs, police brutality, prison riots and violation of human rights stun us all .
Pakistani society views "Zun" (woman) "Zar" (Money) and "Zameen" (Land) as the basic causes of crime and try to treat offender under the centuries old stereotyped methods of strict imprisonment philosopy . 
However, if all the facilities are given to the criminals and all these things prove to be fruitless for a criminal, he truly has no right to live in the society of civilized people and should be dealt with iron hands.
