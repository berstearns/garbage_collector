Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
The topic for arguement that all university degrees are fake seems biased to some extant. As it is both true and false, it can be justified to some extants but not fully. There are so many arguments which go in favor of this statement and vice versa .
Favor:
The arguement says that all university degrees are theoretical. I will talk here with reference to Pakistan. So many factors are there which go in favor of this argument . 
If we look at the syllabus of most of Pakistani post graduate level degrees, it is not up to mark to the needs of recent researches and developments in the particular field. Syllabuses are designed that then years after years, there does not occur any slight change in it. So if, there is a 15 years old research or theory is being taught how can we say or expect that that knowledge will help students in being successful practitioners in practical difficulties and situations .
So need for an up to date syllabus is there to bring betterment in situation. Another pitfall of syllabus is missing of practical part in syllabus. There must be some part of syllabus containing practicals related to the subject which will be helping students in their practical life, field work is necessary to be successful in field .
2. Another reason for supporting this argument is that out universities are not that developed and rich with resource material to make students aware of practical things. Universities lack funds. They can not manage to take their students to field. They cannot arrange trips in respective fields . 
3 Universities are offering some degrees which are not having any practical implementation in life. When students go through the syllabus, pass the degree by reading and learning theories, they are disillusioned. When they are unable to find relevant field for work. There knowledge hindares them in doing anything else. They become utterly disappointed at this point. Because Pakistan is not yet that developed country to have all the fields working in system . 
So, there is a need to go through the syllabus of various degrees to make them up to mark and there is also need of thinking seriously on some titles of degrees which do not have practical or direct practical implication of society to avoid disillusionment is students And to make students useful part of society. It will help in using men power is a better and useful way . 
This statement cann't be taken fully as based on truth. As there are some disciplines where universities are producing remarkable man power which is performing their duties quite efficiently and giving good results to society . 
For example, there is the disciplines of Medicine, Engineering, Agriculture and atomic sciences, where universities are providing maximum theoretical and practical exposure to students. Practicals are integral part of academic practices and students have to do it to get their degrees. In the field of medicine, Laboratories are fully equipped with latest machineris to let students know about the things they have to face in practical life. Universities provide students opportunities to visit hospitals, to the practices being done in hospitals. They become well aware of the practical situations . 
They no longer live in flowery imagination and become used to the hardships they will have to face . 
Then, there is field of Engineering. In this field, considerable importance is given to practical work. Engineers are expected to be perfect after leaving their institutions, So during their studies, they are given practical tasks to cope with practical problems .
Same is there in the field of agriculture. Where students are taken to field and to various relevant places to let them get know how to practices being done in agriculture . 
Apart from these fields, In every subject, universities have made research report or thesis compulsory for students. Student have to go deep into relevent material and then the relevent situation to sort out the solution of the given problem. It makes them aware of the practical life and some of the relevant issues which should be focused .
So it can be said that this statement is neither fully true nor fully wrong. Somehow, people are facing practical problems that is way, they claim so but, here is Pakistan with minimum resources, universities are trying their best to bring good result is form of intelligent students, Who can work efficiently in practical life as well.
