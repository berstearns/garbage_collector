Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
We live in a world that is dominated by science and technology, and it strange that so many of us feel on the surface that this is natural . 
Industrialization is the process of social and economic change that informs the human group from a pre1$industrial society into an industrial one. It is a part of a wider modernistion process, where social change and economic development are closly related with technological innovation, particularly with the development of large scale energy and metallurge production . 
It is also introduces a form of philaspical chane where people obtain a different attitude towards their perception of nature, and a sociological process of ubiquitous rationalisation, 
It is true that modern world is dominated by science and industrialization but the second statement that dreams and imagination has no world can not be accepted as wrong . 
Science is not based upon dreams, science needs logics, facts and experiments not only imagination. Dreams gives inspiration to set our goals, until you have not dreams you can not set your goal. First of all, Pakistan was a dream of Allama Muhammad Iqbal and then it becomes reality on the basis of facts and arguments . 
With out dreaming and imagination no one can make progress, who have no dreams than how we would set their goals? 
In my point of view take the example of a businessman when he think about to run away a new business. First of all, he has a dream, that he will be a successful businessman behind it, he sets goal to achieve his target . 
A student have a dream to be a doctor and he want to come set their goals and objectives with distincit phases. First he plan, how to study? How he should give time to family and his friends. He have to maintain a balance in all the things, but his first priority must be study to fulfill their dream . 
As Quaid said: [Quotation] .
A students keep this phrase in mind and works hard it achieve his goal and ultimately his dreams. There is an intrusting example in the respect of these dreams tat comes true. Faisalabad city is undeveloped before 30 years ago. The successful traders, markters and industrilists have a dream to make Faisalabad modernised and developed city. They negotiate with each other to make this dream a reality. So they start invested in Faisalabad . 
Many textile industries opened. Marketrs and traders start business here. Religiously, socialy, culturaly it is a modernized city now . 
And Now a days it is considered as textile city and "Manchister of Pakistan". Another is example of Mr. Asif Khan, a motivational speaker, a competent, well reputed personality. He groom, train students emotionaly and motivationally. On 17, June, 2010, he addressed to students and said, [Quotation] . 
It is no doubt that world of industrialization is becoming the base of progress. But industrialization give the man go into world of imagination, in industrialization every one know it is worth and could not go beyond the dreams and imagination. It is all due to science and technology. If one has to make progress he has to be relistic in his real life and also follow the world formation according to scientific approaches. But the world of dreams and imagination give a person new hope and incourage them to go ahead. World of imagenation did not let the man die . 
The world of imagenation has it,s own charm and dream gives hope and courage to go ahead, it gives new way to think for a great world of imagenation! In science and technology we have firstly hypothesis then experiment and then results but the world of imagination has It is imperical meanings in it self. It gives the courage to find the dreams of imagination Now a days modern world is totaly influenced by science and technology. The ratio of progress is dependent upon the science and technology. Science has made the man as like machine, It is due to science that we take few seconds to know the whole world . 
Now the progress of science is much enhancing the man towards the moon and they are trying to settle a new world on the other planets. But if we say science is everything, It can not be true . 
Conclusion:- Dreams, Imagination, Science, Technology and industrialization are hand in glove to compete in modern era.
