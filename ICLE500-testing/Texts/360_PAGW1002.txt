Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
It is an admitted fact that the science has progressed very rapidly in every field of life .
In every field of life it has provided us many facilities and without these facilities we feel our life incomplete and of course our life is incomplete without these facilities because we are unable to live and work properly without the facilities provided us by science .
Science has completely changed the society and the man. Development of countries is directly related to the development of science. Defence of countries depends on the technology and the technology is provided by science but saying this that there is no place of dreaming and imagination in this modern world dominated by science and technology is wrong .
It is wrong because immagination and dreaming is the basis of science. At first the man dreamt, then imagined and then discovered many things. New inventions and discoveries are being made everyday so the process of dreaming and immagination is still continued . 
There are some things which are still out of approach of science, so it is the peoples' dream to see or observe them. And about these things scientists have made just imaginations . 
We study about atom but no body has seen atom still, because it is too small. Even an atom cannot be seen under electron microscope. Scientists have made their immaginations about the structure of atom which are very similar to the reality. But is has always been a dream to observe the atom .
Scientists could not reach to the solar system completely and they have gathered information about the planets by artificial satellites using hubble telescope but this information is not accurate but it is just an immagination. They have just landed on the Moon. While they have imaginary information about other planets. It is also dream to land on all other planets of solar system . 
Scientists have landed on the one side of moon but they could not reach to the other side due to its rotation time so it is also a dream to land on the other side of the moon and scientists have imagined that the second part (side) of the moon is very much similar to the first one . 
Scientists have given us information about stars and glaxies. They got information about their distances from each other their areas and temperature etc but all this information is is imaginary .
Scientists have only imagined that how universe came into being. And they have suggested the Big Bang theory as its answer but it is their immagination because any successful experiment has not seen still about this theory .
Industrillization has a lot of importance in the country's trade. The work is being done more fastly and accurately. The production rate has increased a lot. But it is industrillization which is causing pollution, global warming and environmental degradation. These problems are causing many diseases in human beings, plants and animals . 
It is due to scientific knowledge that the cure of many diseases has been discovered, but there are still some diseases whose cure has not been discovered still, the people who have suffered in these diseases have a dream to be healthy again but there is no cure of these diseases so it is also a dream .
At last I would like to write that despite of this fact that science has progressed rapidly and has dominated the world, the dreaming and immagination is in the nature of man and nature of the man cannot be changed by any science.
