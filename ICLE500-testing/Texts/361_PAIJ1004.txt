Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 

Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare the students for the real world. The syllabus in the universities are not according to the practical world. They only contain the bookish knowledge. Though the students get the degrees from university yet this degree do not help them to take various steps in the real life and they are unable to solve the various problems in the life .
The degrees are theoretical as they are not directly linked with the real world. If we consider the example of a student of M.S in Physics then his knowledge is theoretical. The books which are related to his degree are theoretical. He can have the knowledge of equations and the various principles such as Newton's law but he is unable to apply his knowledge in the practical world .
Theoretical world is world is not what we study in books but it is full with the worries, fears, fever and dangers. The university degrees only help to get a job or a name in the society. In this way university degrees are only the source of getting fame and earning money . 
What students study at the university is not related to the practical world. For instance a student of biology study only the theories related to the subject and the important works what the scientist have done in this field. Practical world does not demand for such things. In practical world their deeds are different. Sometimes it happens that a student fully wants away from his/her practical life while getting a university degree. And when he attains the degree the has turned into a different way having different social norms. In this way he/she finds a lot of problems to survive in the practical world and to cope with his/her mates .
Sometimes it happens that a topper and gold medalist fails to survive in the practical world. He faces a lot of difficulties in adjusting himself in the society though his degrees are the source to provide him the theoretical knowledge yet his knowledge is of no use in the practical world. As the demands of the practical world are totally different from what a student study in attaining any university degree. In this way the university degrees are of little value the knowledge which does not help in practical world is useless. It only remains the bookish knowledge . 
Sometimes it happen that though the student study related to practical world they only study for the sake of getting good marks in their university degrees. They remain unable to apply their knowledge in the practical to over come the difficulties and to take various steps related to their practical life . 
The university degrees remain of little value because the knowledge is not conveyed in the correct way to the students. The teachers only give lectures and the students only adopt it in a way of solving the question paper not in a way to use these in solving the problems of practical life. In this way can solve the question paper best but the question of the practical life remains unsolved .
To conclude, we can say that the most university degrees are of the little importance as the degrees are unable to provide the students a better understanding of the practical world. Practical world is not what they study in the books but it has different demands. The students only get the knowledge from the experiences and to have better experiences they have to sacrifice the whole life.
