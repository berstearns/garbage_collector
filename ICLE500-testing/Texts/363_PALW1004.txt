Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?

Before proceeding, it is necessary for us to put a sight in to the characteristics of modern age, its influence on human beings and on our literary work. We should also define imagination .
What is imagination? Imagination is a mental faculty which farms images of external world or objects not present to senses. It is a faculty to think which we actually are not. Imagination is a shelter which we use to relief ourselves from external problems. It is base of all sort of literary piece of work. It opens the way for future. Then how we can say that modern age is not a place to imagin . 
Jules Verve was a French writer. He was not an inventor or scientist but he interpreting many scientific things and events for example travell to moon, hundred years before its happening through his imagination. It was his imagination which showed him the future of world. Imagination explores our feelings, emotions. We imagine the things which give Pleasure and satisfaction to us. Wordsworth, Keats, Coleridge all other Romantic Poets considered imagination very important not only for literary work but for human lives. Let us look what we have lost after giving up the imagination, peace and calmness from our lives .
Modern age is the age of faith and doubt, an age of morality and hypocracy. It is an age of prosperity and age of poverty. It is an age of idealism and age of materialism, age of progress and decline, age of splendour and squalor .
In this modern age there are complexities everywhere. We have faith on ourselves, on our work, struggle, on our fate but still our mind are full of doubt. There is prosperity but is also a poverty everywhere. We have splendid lives, standards but we are sick and upset innerly. Outwardly we are happy but innerly we are anxious. In this age man is more consious about his social condition. The empirical and sceptical spirit of science played a part and helped in dissolution of old social acceptance. The scientific approach affected also the field of economic and social investigation - Science has made our lives easy but very rapid also. It is imposible to imagine how the modern man can survive in the absence of various discoveries and inventions of science . 
Though modern age gives us many things but it also snatches many precious things. For example it takes our peace, calmness, purity of love and our imagination. In this modern age man has changed. His attitude towards life has changed. He has every but no time to look into himself. He is going to be dead innerly. Modern man becomes sick mently .
Our modern literature also shows the conflict of mind. This shows the anxiety, disturbness and lack of imagination. TS Eliot says in his book: [Quotation] 
Leaning togather .
Then it is wrong to say that in modern age there is no place For imagination. Imagination not only makes a man free from worldly problems but also opens the way to futures' great work which is not present but can be present in future like Jule Verne's imagination .
