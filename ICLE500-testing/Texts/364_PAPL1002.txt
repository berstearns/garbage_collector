Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 

If a person is male of female, they are internally weak. They need someone's encourgment that will help them to achieve their aims. In this contemporary world the need of a true religion increases. In this materialistic world people always want someone's help and encouragment that they cannot get from anyone except Allah Almighty . 
When Adam came into this world his descedents started fighting with each other due to the lust of different things. Then Allah Almighty started sending His prophets to the people of this world. It is the obstinacy of the people of this world that maximum people remained infidel and those who accepted prophet 's preaching but in such a way that they proved even themselves worst than infidels. From the religious history of this world we know that whenever a prophet started the preachings of God 's message Maximum people of that particular area of society became his worst foes. Those who accepted his preachings but did not act on the message. Jews, Christians, Muslims who profess that they are true followers of God 's message, but in fact they have divided themselves within their religions into different sects for which they were not asked .
Christians have two main sects Protestants and Catholics. They have also lot of sects in Protestants and Catholic sects e.g. in catholic sect they have Anglicans and Publicans subsects. History is filled with the incidents in which the people of these two main sects and subsects prosecuted, killed, and tormented each other. Same is for Muslims and Jews . 
in which each group tries his best to prosecute the other groups of people and show their superiority . 
History also gives us information that these professedly true believers fought fiercly with each other alot. Crusade wars were most important in which Muslims and Christians tormented each other. Whenever the groups fought with each other, they considered themselves true. All those wars annihilated scores of people. This was not the message of God to kill or prosecute each other, people actually they were compelled by their lust for the benefit of this world. They used religion for their targets. All the theologians, priests of different religions could not understand the sly plans of their leaders . 
In this contemporary world religion still exploits the innocence of the people of this world. But unfortunately we are unaware of this. Scores of people are killed on daily bases. Peace of this world has been snatched and we do not know sins.1$	Religious scholars extols martyrdom and gives assurance that martyrs will always live in paradise forever. Their moms, dads, brothers, and sisters gets good news that due to their kinship they will also be rewarded at the day of judgment . 
Marx aptly said that the religion was the opium of the masses. As opium is drug and it has bad effect on addits metamorphically same is for religions. Those who follow any religion are warned about the punishments, 
after death, when they will be died. In short they are passing pleasureless lives and those who do not follow the preachings of any religion are also sombre. In short we the people of this world are adrift . "If Marx was alive at the end of 20th century, he would replace religion with television". A question emerges here that if he was alive what he could show to the people of this world through television? I think that would be nothing except clich√©. The true remedy for the people of this world lies that all masses should be taught about the real divine preachings of their religions. All the people should be taught that criticism on other religious communities and their prosecution is restricted from God. Then we can see true happiness among the people of this world.
