Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

Science is an organized body of knowledge concerning the physical world, both inanimate and animate. It is, in fact, a large collection of facts, arranged in the form of rules or laws. Scientists use exact methods to observe and study facts and natural phenomena, and do experiments to form laws of science. The sciences are branches of such knowledge and these are natural sciences like biology and geology and the physical sciences like physics and chemistry .
On the other hand, if a person is not exact in his expression and thought and uses his imagination to express much more than what he observes and feels, he may like to study and research in the arts or humanities .
Our is a scientific world. We depend on science in a great many ways. We know that science is necessary for the progress of any country. Scientists have made use of science for the benefit of man and society. They have used scientific principals, laws, and facts to invent and develop machines of different kinds. For example, the motor-car, aero plane and railway engines, printing machines, different kinds of machines used in factories producing things of daily use like match boxes, cloth paper, shoes and so on have been invented by scientists. The telephone, the calculator and computer are among the latest electronic inventions that have made our life modern and comfortable .
Scientists and doctors have invented and developed medicines that can cure speedily dangerous diseases like typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis. Now human beings can live much longer than in older times. Even animals and birds get the finest medical treatment in modern hospitals where effective medicines and suitable facilities are all the time available .
Moreover information technology, as software industry, for operating the data programmes and systems of computer came to be widely used in the last twenty years . 
The technological advances of modern science have revolutionized our life patterns. The electronic industry, started in 20th century, has reached unimaginable heights of development. Science has transformed transportation magically, as now the supersonic jet can take man to the farthest end of the world in hours, and rocket can take him to the moon and even beyond. The fast moving submarines can pierce through the sea water under the surface to long distances with the help of radar, for the scientific and business purposes . 
In fact, science teaches us to work without prejudice. Scientists in all countries use the same formulas, laws and results. They should, therefore, work togather for the advancement of human kind .
So we can say that with all the progress in science, imaginations or dreaming cannot replace it. Because imagination is not based on facts and it also does not need any kind of rules or laws. It is totally based on free working of mind without any results. Imagination and dreaming is only useful in the world of arts and poetry because it is used to judge a poet . 
The power of imagination escap us from the real world and it brings human beings into a world far away from realities. There is no realistic approach in the world of fantacy and dreaming . 
The above mentioned information about science is totally based on facts but in the world of imagination there is no place of facts and laws. The world of dreaming is only give us pleasure and happiness for sometimes because it escap us from the harsh realities of life. When we came back from this world everything is broken into pieces. Because the world of science and technology is far away from this world.
