Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
In the start of human civilization, man was quite brutal. There were great quarrals on small matter. People used to kill the enemies or opponents without thinking of settlement. These fights used to continue upto many generations. As the time passed the wild sentiments of man turned to civilized one. His sudden bitter reaction reduced and he invented courts and jails etc and take his revenge through some men of authority and wisdom, who were elected or selected for sake of justice in society. This method made the revenge legal. At present time human civilization is at certain stage that it carries jails and courts to punish its guilties. Laws and rules are designed according to the type and intensity of crime, to punish the criminal for his/her bad deed .
Human being carried some wild feelings and tendencies to do crime under certain specific conditions, when usually he get out of temper. The cause of crime may be his/her rage or interest for some benefit or to hide some mistake of his or her own. So man commits crimes which effect others. At present time, when civilization has flourish very much, the innocents complain the related department for example police department, it arrests culprit and take him to jail, then on the basis of argument and witness it is decided by courts whether culprit is guilty or not. If he/she is not guilty, he/she is left. Otherwise, he/she is put in to jail and some punishment is decided for him with respect to his/her crime . 
It is quite right way for the peace and harmony of a society to punish its criminals. Because innocents want justice, if criminal is not punished, the effected one will have the feelings of rageness and anger. So he will commit the same crime for sake of his internal peace. To abolish his feelings of grief, effected person will do some thing bad and bitter to fulfil his feeling of revenge, he may commit theft, he may torture his opponent by hitting, he may kidnap some one or he may even kill his opponent, if his rage is out of control. This situation will disturb the part of society where all this is being happened. There would be internal restlessness and social disturbance etc .
It is said that the criminal should not be punished in a civilized society, but he should be rehabilitated. Then the firs objection that arise is that the society is enough civilized that it has its moral values to provide justice to some innocent, who is disturbed without any appropriate reason. Civilization does not say the guilities should be given protection instead of its innocent. If the criminals are protected by so called rehabilitation, society should not be said civilized but absurd . 
As there is matter of rehabilitation, so it depends on the choise of effected person, if he finds courage to apologize his guilty, then he should be rehabilitated otherwise he must be punished . 
It is human nature to commit crime when he wants physical or mental escape from some unwanted situation. If the criminal is not punished in order to rehabilitate him, he may not be fully corrected; and may commit some or other crime unconsciously, because it is psychologically proved that "Habits never change, it is just intensity which changes".e.g. If a man torture some other man physically and being arrest and punished. Next time he will not only doing same thing but also stop other doing this. Because he will have fear of his socialy repute. While in case of rehabilitation, no such thing will occur. Criminals would be punished because it is law of Holy Quran to punish criminals. Rules have been established by Allah the creator of the world, Almighty. Quran says that there must be hand for hand, ear for ear, eye for eye and blood for blood. This order of Quran can not be carried out by rehabilitation And who disobey Allah are being cursed in this world and world next to death.
