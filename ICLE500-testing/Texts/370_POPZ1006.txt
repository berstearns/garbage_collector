Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
University studies are the highest level of education provided by most of the world's education systems. Theoretically, graduating from a university is something of a great value. It is supposed to mean getting a better job, university graduates are associated with high social position. Therefore a lot of young people decide to study at university. After having graduated from a secondary school they decide to continue their education and the most prestigious way to do it is to enter a university. However, in nowadays' world the number of students who are disappointed after having graduated from a university is increasing. The value of a university degree seems to lessen. The knowledge gained at a university does not help young people to achieve success. The fact that the value of a university degree is very little in the real world is conditioned by various factors .
First of all, during the studies a student is "forced" by a curriculum to choose less and less subjects which automatically leads to concentrating on a very narrow segment of knowledge. This in turn means putting less effort in studying other, in one's opinion less important subjects. The most obvious example of negative consequences of such a narrow specialization is incompetence of medicine doctors. Having great and detailed knowledge in one field they very frequently cannot diagnose properly illnesses of a more general nature .
Secondly, the more prestigious studies are, the more theoretical, knowledge is required from students. Additionally, such knowledge concerns various fields. Students of economy, for example, during the five years of their studies have to study various subjects which tackle different problems that are not necessarily connected with one another. Such theoretical knowledge proves to be useless in a real world because usually, at least as far as economy is concerned, practical knowledge is definitely more profitable than the one gained at a university .
The distinction between practical and theoretical knowledge is connected with another factor contributing to the theory that university degrees are of little value in the real world. The knowledge that a student has after having graduated from a university is only theoretical. In very few cases students have an opportunity to use their knowledge in practise or to gain professional experience while studying. However nowadays, the key-word while applying for a job is "Experience". The number of years one has worked in a particular profession is in most of the cases more important than the marks he/she got for his/her M.A. thesis. The very basic requirements imposed on people who want to work for some prestigious firm are the ability to work on a computer and to use a fax-machine (not to mention typing), fluency in more than one foreign language. These are the things which are usually not included in a curriculum of studies. Consequently, usually none of them is a requirement for getting a university degree. What follows, for a potential employer the fact that an employee has finished university is of a very little importance and in most of the cases will not be the decisive argument during the job - interview .
All the above arguments lead to the conclusion that graduating from a university does not mean that a young man or woman is prepared to face the requirements of the real world. The prestige of a university degree remains unchanging but in order to achieve success in nowadays' world one needs knowledge from various fields. So the fact that one has graduated from a university will remain only a subject of a personal satisfaction as long as one does not prove that he/she is really good at something. Then a university degree will become the trump in one's hand and claiming that it has some value will not be baseless anymore .
