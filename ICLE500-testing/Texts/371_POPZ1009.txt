Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
I do not agree with this statement. I think that the prison system is the best way to punish criminals provided that every sentence is actually executed without any exceptions. In the cases of the worst atrocities there should be the capital punishment introduced and executed without changing it into imprisonment under any circumstances .
As long as human race exists there has always existed crime. People established certain laws to curb crime and for many years depriving an individual of his or her freedom or just taking away his or her life has been the only way of protecting society from cruelty, of misfits. Punishment inflicted on those who broke the law does not seem to be a sufficient deterrent only when it is not executed entirely for some reason or other. That is also why there is still a growing number of cases of so called serial killers. Those are the people who kill repeatedly, particularly after being released from prison too early .
Another aspect of the subject is choosing the right punishment for the most serious crimes. There are cases in which the capital punishment is indispensable. Let's look at the example of Dennis Nilsen, a British mass murderer who killed twelve people and dismembered the bodies of his victims. Some time ago he appeared on TV to give an interview in which he presented explicit details of his atrocities. His words delivered in a matter-of fact tone could almost serve as a beginners guide for potential killers on "how to murder and dispose of your victims". When the interview was broadcast, it gave Nilsen four minutes of fame and granted him a celebrity status and glamour. It is not difficult to imagine, however, how much distress this programme brought to the relatives of Nilsen's victims, and what is more, it could have encouraged others to follow him. Such a warped man as Nilsen should have been excluded from society long ago, not only by imprisonment, but by the capital punishment .
Rehabilitating people who committed grisly crimes should not take place in a civilised society. This may lead to the anaesthetization to the human cruelty and the whole society may become inured to violence. Dubious remorse shown by criminals is going to evolve into new atrocities very quickly. The individuals who commit crimes are usually weak, ineffectual people and they can assert some power only by killing or by other kind of breaking the law. Very often they themselves admit that they are not able to lead normal life and in exceptional cases, like in case of Westley Dodd, they publicly plead to be executed for their crimes .
There are many arguments for the prison system and against rehabilitation of criminals. Obviously, such a severe punishment is right for them, and what is more, it scares others. Anybody who wants to commit a crime must know for sure that when it comes out, there is no other way but prison. Such system eliminates from the society individuals that may have a very destructive influence on others. Besides, the money that would be spent on rehabilitation of criminals should be allocated to the prevention of crimes instead. What is also very important, the society must know for sure that there is justice in their country and that all the criminals are going to be punished properly. Nobody would like to see acts of revenge done by victims' families in a civilised society .
Bearing all this facts in mind, I think that the prison system is by no means outdated and that every civilised society should punish its criminals in this way .
