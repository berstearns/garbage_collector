Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". 
 
An encyclopaedic entry gives such a definition of money: ' a common, unchanging equivalent of goods which marks their value and can be exchanged for them'. Its origins, dating as late as four to six thousand years ago, are connected with a sociological division of labour which found its expression in the separation of husbandry from handicraft. As a consequence, a surplus of certain goods appeared which could serve as means of exchange. Those goods which were the most transferable became directly exchangable for all the other articles and thus money originated. In the earlier ages, various commodities served as money, later precious metals such as silver and gold started to function as a general equivalent .
From this brief history of money and its invention, it can be observed that it is possible to mark an exact moment when money began to be present in the existence of the mankind. Thus the saying that money is the root of all evil seems to be rather unlogical. It is not easy to state when evil came into being, it seems to be a sort of universal category and a feature of all human beings. While evil has existed as late as our first ancestors started to inhabit the Earth, money is but a human invention, just a useful tool which makes the trade more efficient. Rather, man's love of possessing, greed and unlimited desire to have causes all the wrong which money is unjustly blamed for .
It is, however, true that money rules the world. As far as historic sources can tell us, there has always been a certain regularity concerning money. It is, the clear distinction between those who have been in possession of money and those who put a lot of effort to gain it. Moreover, what can be easily noticed is the striking disproportion between these two categories of people. The number of those, who have been trying to find out various ways of possessing it, in other words becoming rich, remains in a predominant majority to those who actually already have had it and have been rich .
My view is that it is this disproportion which can be accounted for the evil in the world, not money itself. The common lack of it, on the one hand, and demoralizing power of its excess in much fewer cases seem to be a problem. For it is a universal truth that the disturbance in balance is the source of trouble. Our society, in a result of civilisational progress, operates on such principles which condition the fact that even the most basic needs of man can be fulfilled only when paid for. Food, clothes, accommodation, entertainment, every single item in our surrounding has its price. Even human body as a whole or just its separate parts have a market value and can be sold. In fact, everything has its certain value expressed in some amount of money .
The natural and distinctive feature of all people is aiming at comfort and security. There is nothing immoral in this tendency. Further, possession of money gives many obvious opportunities and options of fuller existance. The problem appears when not everyone can achieve all the advantages simply because of the lack of money. Again, the impossibility of existing in a modern world without it is clear. The living examples might be all the people who struck by the extreme poverty have found themselves at the very bottom of social piramide, nearly loosing their human dignity. They would, for sure, attribute their status to the lack of money .
The opinion that money cannot give happiness has been functioning for ages. Is it really so? People asked for the definition of happiness would probably point at health, knowledge, security or love. Money, of course, is not a direct equivalent of all these things but if one wants to be honest, it would be necessary to admit that money, to a great extent, helps to achieve all of them .
Money itself has little value. It is just a scrap of paper or a piece of metal. How can it be, than, so powerful that, on the one hand, it may help to achieve ultimate happiness and, on the other hand, it is the underlying cause of crime, hatred, humiliation, ignorance, depravation and corruption. Money is not evil. Rather, evil which, just as good, is an innate feature of all human beings makes them treat money as a good excuse for all the wrong in the world .
