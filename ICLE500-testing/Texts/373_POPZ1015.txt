Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The contemporary world is becoming more and more influenced by science and industrialisation A contemporary man does lot realise how much science contributes to his or her life. When a telephone, a TV set, a radio or a computer are so common as any other everyday facility, man unconsciously diverts his or her attention from dreaming and imagination. That influence is a threat that has the gradual effect on all of us, it diminishes our ability to think thus to dream or imagine .
There are various other factors that limit the development of our mind. First, the communication development, as it has become so easy, there is less need to concentrate the mind. To receive information, we need only sit in front of the TV set and flick from channel to channel with a remote control. To impart information, we need only pick up a telephone and throw out phrases in random sequence, punctuated with "ums" and "errs". In the 60s the Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan predicted the advent of film and TV would have as radical an effect on our culture as the invention of a printing press had on the culture of the Middle Ages. He predicted that books would become obsolete in one generation. He has been proved wrong in that point, however, who knows what would happen in 100 or 200 hundred years, as although more books are now published than ever before, the vast majority of these books demand little literacy, imagination and intelligence. Having been at the centre of our culture for the past 3 or 4 hundred years, they have now been pushed to the margins, either as adjuncts to TV series, or as a form of entertainment for those few moments when we are out of reach of a screen - on the beach, on a plane, or as a help to prepare people for sleep at the end of a busy day .
Twenty or thirty years ago, writing letters, keeping diaries were common, people could use words to communicate various, vague emotions, they could use their minds to express thoughts in a concise form. Nowadays, with the use of electronic aids, telephones, videos, faxes, etc., there is no longer place for words, now the content is more important than the form and we are beginning to abandon the habits of thought. It is very frightening as it all starts very early, computer toys, digital watches, calculators, computers are present in the children's lives from the very beginning. Children instead of learning to think grow up convinced that these electronic aids are their right. They learn dead vocabulary that has nothing to do with Shakespeare or Milton. The impute of information they get is boring and mindless and the use of computer breed laziness and discontent. From the very childhood they learn that thinking and organising will be done for them and later this computer generation assumes that it is better to calculate, buy petrol, tell the time, pat the bills or shop with the aid of a computer. Children and young people glued to the computer screen will be more and more common phenomenon. Parents, unaware of a danger, are happy that their beloved kids are developing their minds while they in fact do nothing of that sort playing violent, sophisticated computer games. These children have simply no time for thinking and their behaviour is just the sign of the fact we are entering the computer age which is the age of dehumanisation. What is even more scaring is that people who express misgivings about the use of electronic aids by children are considered to be unimaginative, old-fashioned and out-of touch .
To sum up one can draw one frightening conclusion that there is apparently no way in which we can stop the development of science and industrialisation. The only possible solution lie in ourselves it should be of our concern not to allow technology to interfere with our lives too much and to use it wisely, trying not to eliminate from our lives the ability to think, communicate, love, dream, and imagine. However, one must ask him/herself the question whether he/she is strong enough to resist the influence of science and technology. In the majority of cases the answer will be no, as it impossible to do so. What is left then? Are we going to turn into mindless creatures without imagination and dreams?
