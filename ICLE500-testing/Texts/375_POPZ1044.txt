Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Man has always dreamt of making his life easier. Primates had to struggle for survival and try to improve harsh conditions of life. With time, man started to feel secure and warm in his cave; yet, out of greediness he wanted more and more ... He dreamt of better life with permanent light inside his dwelling place, he dreamt of being able to fly and move from place to place quickly and easily. Most of his dreams came true and man became an advanced creature who managed to achieve a lot thanks to the power of reason. But a price had to be paid for this ...
Now man has everything his forefathers dreamt of but does it mean that he does not dream any more? And here a paradox arises - man wants to go back to his roots. He longs for a quiet, peaceful life, far from the sight of sky-scrapers and traffic jams. Of course it is mere wishful thinking as we have gone too far in our run for making our lives better and it is practically impossible to turn back now .
It is obvious that our lives are dominated by modern science and technology - we are victims of our own creation - but I would not agree that there is no place for dreaming and imagination in this world. Very often people are simply ashamed to admit it but dreams have always been an important part of their lives. The fact that we live in the age of spacecraft does not mean that imagination has been rejected. It may not be as explicit as it was in Homer's days when Greeks lived in the world full of gods created by their own imagination, but it is present in our lives. Like our Victorian predecessors we feel endangered by the development of science and technology and that is why we try to escape into the world of dreams. It is possible by means of literature and Disney lands. The former is very fertile. It has always been the means of giving way to emotions of various kind and imagination running wild. Writers, poets in particular, have tried to show the beauty of the world and contrasted it with the ugliness of big cities and their industrial development. Some film makers have also used their imagination in order to create an unreal but beautiful world of fairies and good spirits, and as an outcome we have such films as "Hook" or Disney productions. I remember how sad I was after watching "Hook" and how I kept asking myself, "Why don't we live in a fairyland where everything is so pretty and simple? Good wins over evil and everybody is happy?" But then I came to the conclusion that this world is in fact inside us and we are the only ones who can make it live on or die .
A Disney land is a paradise not only for children but also for adults. It is a place where grown-ups forget about the existence of taxes, bills, morgages, etc. It is a place where time has stopped and where everyone forgets about their problems just for a while .
But not only is there a tendency in art to escape into the world of dreams but also in architecture. People get and tired of concrete and iron and they seek after solitude in the countryside. The cottages adorned with flower baskets are a truly delightful sight and to me they are an expression of people's longing for simplicity and peacefulness .
I have tried to show that people of all ages have had various dreams and desires. It is obvious that they differ from age to age but they have always been and always will be present in mankind no matter how more advanced we may become. And I really do hope that Aldous Huxley's gloomy prophecies presented in his novel [Reference] will never come true and that people won't turn into unfeeling creatures deprived of this precious thing called imagination .
