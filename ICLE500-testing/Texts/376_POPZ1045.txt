Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". 
 
At the very beginning I should say that I only partly agree with the above statement. In my opinion money is the root of evil indeed but certainly not of all of it. There are other reasons that make people choose the wrong path. Those could be ambition, power, fame, or even alcohol and these do not have to have anything in common with money .
Let us imagine two old ladies who are neighbours. They always try to exceed each other in everything. Both of them have the most beautiful gardens in the area, best cut lawns and hedges. But one day one of the ladies finds out that her neighbour has bought four splendid greyhounds which look so terrific playing in the garden. Unfortunately she has no funds to buy herself four dogs that are so expensive. She cannot stand the fact that her neighbour is better. She steals secretely to the neighbour's garden and she poisons the dogs. She did an extremely evil thing which was caused by her sense of being better than others, her ambition and also jealousy. What does it have to do with money? Nothing, unless we say that she had to by a poison for it .
Doing evil things for power or fame many times is connected with money. There are people who strive to get better positions or to became famous it would give them more money, or better connections which would make it easier to make money. But we need to point out the fact that there are many maniacs who love to be in charge of everything and they would every evil thing in order to have everyone in their hands, to manipulate people and kame them dependent .
At the very beginning I have mentioned also alcohol as one of the reasons for evil behaviour. We all know how many murders are committed by people who are intoxicated. Alcohol makes people unable to think logically. Murders are effects of a momentary impuls raised by anger which could not be suppressed by reason. What does this have to do with money? Nothing at all, unless again we say that the murderer needed money to buy some alcohol. Of course we can agree that people murder for money, but there are also other reasons: insanity, jealousy of a husband etc .
The words of a song yet are true. Money is the root of evil because it is the only mean for our life commodity. If we have money we live better. But in order to have money we have to earn them by hard work and not all people are hard-working. On the other hand there are jobs in which no matter how hard you try you will not earn enough money to feed your family. Finally, there are people for whom there is no job at all. These people might do evil like cheating or stealing. In this way money again has been found to be the core of evil deeds .
Yet everything depends mainly on the personal qualities of a particular individual. For one person money could matter very much, the other could not care for it at all .
