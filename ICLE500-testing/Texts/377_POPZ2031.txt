Title: Is capital punishment different in kind from other sorts of judicial sanction? If it were shown to be effective in deterring  crimes of certain sorts, would that justify its use? 
 
First of all the state is an institution based on the general agreement of the people. Thus, maintaining that it is the state that uses capital punishment, seems to be a tentative euphemism aimed at making our responsibility rather remote. I personally think, that it is the society and not the state, who permits to eradicate criminals. Hence I intend to use people rather than state as a referent in this essay .
Having clarified this we can procede to the discussion of capital punishment. Is it a punishment? If so what is its role? What are the arguments of its protagonists and antagonists? Is it justifiable? These are the basic questions I shall try to answer in this essay .
Punishment is an infliction of pain, suffering, discomfort or death on a person who has infringed the law, rule or custom of the community. In ancient times it was exacted on the basis of the "eye-for-an-eye" rule and was designed only to satisfy the thirst for revenge. Today we claim to be a more civilized society and design punishments not to revenge, but to reform. The major aspect of any punishment is to create the possibilities for the offenders to reeducate themselves, and, having served their sentences, to start new lives, and be useful to the community. Capital punishment is devised exclusively to eradicate people who have committed a mistake, however gross it might have been. It is ultimate, it does not give a second chance. In this respect it fails to meet the requirements of a civilized punishment .
Many of the protagonists of death penalty hold that its main role is to deter the violent crime. They claim that the numbers of offenders who carry guns have increased enormously in the countries, which abolished capital punishment. However the antagonists maintain otherwise. Namely, that death penalty is not an effective deterrent. According to them statistics prove that violent punishment does not tend to bring about a decrease in violent crime .
Another issue, fervently discussed by both parties, is the question of morality. Advocates of death penalty believe it immoral that the taxpayers, who may fall prey to murderers and rapists, should pay for their upkeep in prisons. This claim is difficult to refute. Nevertheless killing people, even if they are habitual criminals, can hardly be called moral. Neither jury nor judge should have the power to put an end to a human life. The antagonists of death penalty would probably conclude that it perpetuates the very evil it seeks to remove .
To stop the viscious circle, the opposition of capital punishment postulates a prison reform. They emphasize the fact that the object of modern penal system is not only the protection of society but also the reclamation of the criminal. Reeducation and reclamation of an offender, they believe, is likely to reduce the amount of crime. The only answer their adversaries give, is that hardened murderers are beyond hope of reform. On the expiry of their sentences they return as the source of danger to the society. Thus eradicating them is the same as cutting of a diseased organ. But who is to judge that the disease can't be cured?
This short discussion of the main points linked to the problem of capital punishment leads to the final question. Is death penalty justifiable? Though, as we have seen, it is a complex issue, but an instinctive answer is simple. Death penalty is not justifiable. First and foremost, it does not meet the requirements of a civilized penal code, because it denies the criminal the right to reform. Second, it does not seem to be an efficient deterrent. Statistics are ambiguous in this respect as it is difficult to account for all sociological factors involved. It also raises numerous moral questions and does not solve any. Finally, it does not cure the society from evil, but only removes responsibility for it from all of us, to one, to the offender. Capital punishment is nothing more than a confession on the part of the community of a failure to protect, educate and support its every member .
