Title: Against the death penalty

The advocates and opponents of death penalty have been arguing for a very long time. Although there are still fervent followers on both sides of the argument, in the contemporary world one of these sides seems to be gaining advantage over the other .
Countries which are often - and justly, I think - referred to as the most advanced, the most civilized ones, have moved radically away from death penalty. All over Europe this kind of punishment is considered both inhuman and inefficient, and was cancelled more or less recently. As for the United States, it is still valid in some states but is rarely implemented and - even in such a crime-ridden and violent society as America seems to be - often harshly criticized .
The conclusion we are fully entitled to draw from this tendency is that it is what has been constituting our European culture that induces us to abandon death penalty the idea of which clashes sharply with our humanist tradition. This tradition, after centuries of controversy, seems now at last firmly established in our societies, calling upon us to scrap this kind of punishing people for good .
The argument stated above puts death penalty and the need for eradicating it from our lives into a larger, more general perspective. It is fully vindicated in itself but there are also some more substantial grounds that may further reinforce the point we make .
First, those who favour capital punishment believe that it exercises a deterrent effect upon would-be offenders. However, if we look at the statistic data we will see that those deeming so cannot find there any confirmation of their views. Surveys carried all over the world show clearly that the threat of punishment by death neither lessens the number of crimes nor makes those committed any less brutal .
Secondly, we must keep in mind that having sentenced somebody to death and having administered the sentence we cannot rescind it; it is absolutely irrevocable. And what if all of a sudden it turns out that the judges who passed such a verdict were wrong? That there occurred a mistake in the evidence or in the procedure? What if some factor which was hidden or simply overlooked crops up and alters the entire situation? This may always happen. Yet if it does, nothing can be done just because the person who was regarded as guilty and who now appears to be innocent is already punished; in other words - dead. In such circumstances all we can do, apart from chasing the real criminal, is to announce to the world that the person who was sentenced and punished was in fact blameless but by doing so we hardly do justice to him or her as we simply cannot bring them back to life. This is obvious. But let us try more to see the obviousness of things also before, not only after, we have decided to act .
Our third point, unlike the two former ones, does not belong to the sphere of the statistically factual and the immediately verifiable. Thus, it is not so easily observable. This does not mean that it is in any degree more negligible or lacking in urgency. It appeals to our sense of what is and what isn't morally proper, and stems from the ability to feel empathy towards other people, no matter who they are. It boils down to the conviction that it is not the same to be murdered unawares in some dark wood or street and to be put to death in prison. A victim of a murderer might have hoped that he or she would be saved miraculously or would manage to escape, and this hope may be cherished almost to the very end. He or she does not know when exactly (if at all) they will be dead. This is a blessing; it saves an enormous amount of distress that comes from expectation and certainty in these matters. But the prisoner sentenced to death is not spared this knowledge and consequently has to bear the anguish resulting from it. He or she knows for sure that (and when) their execution will take place. This must be unendurable. The position of the prisoner waiting on death row is therefore incomparable with that of, say, somebody who is shot down in a hold-up or knifed or strangled in a marital quarrel. The state must consider carefully what it does to its citizens, even if those in question happen to be criminals. Naturally, wrongdoers have to be punished. But punishing them one must avoid all pain and suffering that is unnecessary, superfluous. And the practice of death penalty causes far too much of such suffering .
Considering the above factors we find it deeply absurd that there are countries where death penalty is still legal .
