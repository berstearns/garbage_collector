Title: Death Penalty - for or against? 
 
Death penalty is definitely nonsensical. Nowadays we notice a rapid deacrese in inflicting capital punishment, which is indicative of the general loss of belief in its purposefulness. The fact that death penalty ceases to be popular is caused by a hightened awarness of the value of human life. After so terrible experiences as the two world wars we seem to be more cautious and hesitant when considering taking man s life .
The strongest argument that can be levelled against death penalty is its inhumanity. Unlike other punishmenys, this does not have any educational function, at least for the convict. The only, though very doubtful, value of capital punishment is its role as the deterrent of potential criminals who premeditate committing a crime, a murder in this case. Thus the significance of the punishment, if we assume that punishment can bring any positive results, is shihted from the individual to society. The individual is sentenced to death penalty not to be prevented from committing further crimes but to threaten the community against repeating his grave mistake. Yet, as we fortunately managed to observe, killing the murderers have never been a successful method of getting rid of them. Quite the opposite, cruel laws always produced ruthless and insensitive people who, living under harsh rule themselves, disregarded the universal and undeniable value of human life. Severe laws do not educate society but deprive people of their intrinsic moral sense, and thus create a vicious circle .
Crime cannot be eradicated by laws because they do not concern the motives but the effects of offensive behaviour. Although for society it is much easier to threaten individuals than to promote humanistic values, we should not limit our efforts in crime prevention to mere negative measures, but we should also try to positively influence the system which gives birth to criminals .
It should be considered whether killing, or to state it more eupheministically, liquidating murderers, deserves to be called a fair punishment. When a murder has been committed and the murderer is in the hands of justice, he is no longer dangerous to anyone. Closed in a prison cell, he is completely defenceless and helpless, even if he realizes his mistake and repends it. He is not given a chance to make any resolutions. He cannot make amends. Thus if we kill such a person, we are not better than he and our killing is as ruthless as his. Accordingly, executing a capital punishment on a helpless person is tantamount to a premeditated murder .
Still, assuming that death penalty is an appropriate punishment for murderers, we can never be sure what motives underlied the crime, whether it was premeditated or accidental, or whether it was committed consciously or in a state of irresponsibility. The evidence is often too vague or even contradictory, which does not conduce to impartial judgement. Insisting on justice, we can easily make a fatal and irreversible mistake sentencing to death an innocent person .
Finally, we can question our right to put ourselves in the position of masters of life and death. Life, especially human life, is still a great mystery to us. Man is not capable of fathoming this mystery and creating life on his own. Therefore, being completely ignorant of the origin and aim of life, he should not destroy it .
