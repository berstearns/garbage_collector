Title: English is an easy language to learn 
 
People all over the world learn foreign languages. One reason, why they do it is international communication. It is English that seems to win the competition for primacy among the languages round the world as it is believed to be the easiest one to learn and the most widely used. It is however disputable whether English is in fact the easiest language to learn and there are obviously different opinions in that matter. A number of certain factors should be taken into consideration in that case. First of all we should take a closer look from the point of view of the learners. We cannot of course forget comparing learning English to learning other languages from the point of view of linguistics as it seems to be the key point in the whole discussion. It is obvious that any two languages have different grammars, vocabulary and syntax .
We may try to ask the non native learners of English the question whether it is easy to them to learn the language. It seems to be common among them to approach it from the side of its grammar. Frequently we can hear that English is very difficult because you must learn a number of tenses, conditionals, passives, modals or irregular verbs, what seems to be a lot more than in other languages and in this way much more difficult. Another point of view may assume that English is difficult because of strange pronunciation rules or sometimes rather their lack. Frequently the teachers can hear questions like ' Why is this sequence of letters read in a different way in these two words?'. These difficult to answer questions definitely influence student's motivation and that in effect makes learning more complex .
We should also take a closer look at English from the point of view of linguists. Here we will apply the most common way of exploring the language which is based on comparison with a number of other languages. Shortening the whole procedure we will base on obvious facts which are known even to ordinary people with a little linguistic experience. It is widely known that most European languages in their grammars have genders, complicated inflection of various parts of speech connected with it, various types of declination and different word order rules. When we compare those factors with their equivalents in English it is clearly noticeable that in English they are much simpler or sometimes nonexistent. Best example could be the fact that there are no genders in English except a few nouns which have feminine or masculine character like ' actor (actress' or ' man (woman ' which however do not influence declination of any parts of speech. Linguists will also point out certain regularities in grammar which are simpler than in any other language like: ' All progressive tenses have verbs with ing ending.'. They will probably claim that the rules are easy to understand or even sometimes unnecessary but it is enough to remember a few certain schemes. These arguments surely support the claim that English is an easy language to learn .
The division introduced here between the learners and the knowers was intended to show contrasting attitudes towards English and its learning. It should be admitted that there may be some opinions that this division is inadequate to the real situation but the author based his opinion on his own experience as the learner and the teacher at the same time. Concluding we could state, basing on the linguistic point of view. that learning English is at most aspects easier than learning other languages .
