Title: English is an easy language to learn
 
English, the language that is currently being learnt by the approximate number of 2 million people all over the world, has undoubtedly gained similar importance as Latin in the Middle Ages. As it has become the international code of communication both in computing and business, no wonder that more and more people commence learning it, usually not as a means of reading Shakespeare's works in the original but simply by necessity, such as enhancing their career opportunities or doing deals with foreign investors. The world seems to have chosen its universal language, but has it made a good choice, at least as far as the degree of difficulty in learning it is concerned?
It is usually the case that the first encounter with English, for both the adult and teenage learners, is very rewarding. Everyone who takes up learning is acquainted at least with several phrases or well-known words they have come across in their everyday life, watching satellite programmes, playing computer games or simply from their mother tongue, which is replete with loanwords. The fact that English nouns on the whole are not subject to inflection and verbs do not conjugate makes the beginners feel confident and motivated to learn such a language that appears to be ' much easier than Polish and Russian'. For those who are risk-takers speaking does not pose any problems at all, as they simply make use of the scope of vocabulary they have acquired so far and try to make themselves understood. Once the learners have overcome the fear of mastering the infamous sixteen tenses and the rules governing articles, over which every beginner loses sleep, they come to the conclusion that English grammar is digestible and even comparatively easy. Another argument supporting the alleged effortlessness of mastering English, or at least the ability to communicate easily in it, is the abundance and accessibility of pedagogical material, both authentic and inauthentic, designed for teaching this language. Taking advantage of the comparative studies of English and Polish languages enables teachers to predict and eradicate possible errors made by learners and thus facilitates learning .
However, one may justifiably wonder why ever learners spend so much time, even several years, before they can honestly admit they have mastered the level of proficiency in English and even then can still be taken by surprise with a phrase or word they have never seen or heard before? This can of course be true of any other language, but is it not striking that it so frequently happens to learners of English? The reason for it is, unarguably, the remarkable richness of the English vocabulary, with the multitude of meanings one word may have, its figurativeness and innumerable idioms and phrasal verbs. Therefore the longer one is bent upon English the more they seem to realise what a difficult and painstaking task they have undertaken. When we take into account the problematic spelling and not so easy pronunciation and intonation, the whole matter appears to be far more complicated than at first glance .
Fortunately, the estimation whether English is an easy language to learn or not still remains a matter of individual approach and attitude. Even though someone finds it extremely complicated does it necessary have to produce a discouraging result? But it may be advisable to bear in mind the optimistic opinion about this language and console oneself with this thought in hard times, as one thing is certain: there is, and definitely will be, no escape from English whatsoever .
