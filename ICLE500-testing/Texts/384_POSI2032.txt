Title: English is an easy language to learn
 
Is English an easy language? I would say yes. That opinion is also shared by my fellow-students from the English Department who brush up their English and are certainly proud of its acquaintance. The same question asked in a classroom of teenagers in a primary school will not trigger such as an unanimous response. Well, first of all, any foreign language taught institutionally has to be learned, tested and graded. Naturally, those musts will deter some of the ' less-gifted ' language learners from even hearing English. Attitude and character seem to be here one of the key concepts. Therefore psychologists maintain that extroverts are more apt to acquire second language, while introverts are not expected to make an astounding progress due to their timid disposition and the ascribed lack of communicativeness .
Supposedly, a mediocre but conscientious person whose attitude towards English is fairly favourable intents to learn that language. What facts will he have to face? English may seem difficult to grasp due to its, as it may appear, boundless vocabulary of 500.000 words and 300.000 technical terms. However, a student of FC level needs 5.000 words to be communicatively efficient. The pronunciation might be one of the problems our tongue will have to wrestle with. English [(] and [(] do not have their counterparts in Polish, so only more gifted learners would be able to utter those sounds in the way that will neither resemble [d] or [ t] in the case of the latter and [f] corresponding to the former. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet and 45 sounds. That fact discourages Polish native speakers who use 32 letters and produce 37 sounds. That disproportion of sounds and letters in both languages at least partly explains the apparent discrepancy between the English spelling and pronunciation .
While pronunciation and large English lexicon constitute disadvantages, simplicity of form may easily outweigh them - Polish, Spanish, German or Greek operate on the basis of inflections which indicate singular or plural, person and tense. One of the examples supporting that statement would be the conjugation of the English verb in Simple Present Tense. Adding - s or - es endings in the third person singular seems to be an easy task in comparison with the same procedure in Russian or German. There are seven cases in the declination of the Polish noun and the chore becomes even more complicated if adjectives precede the noun. In English, adjectives do not change according to the noun .
Another characteristic for the benefit of English is its flexibility. The same word can operate as different parts of speech. One of many examples is the word paper. We can drink from paper cups, read a paper and paper a living-room .
The free acceptance of foreign words made English, or more so its American variation an international language. Coupon, kindergarten, graffito, desperado would be instantly understood by the French, Germans, Italians and the Spanish respectively. Although the pronunciation or the spelling of some borrowings may change, they will be easily recognised and used .
English is the most widespread language with 400 million speakers. It is also recognised as the second official language in 60 countries. Do the given facts support the statement that English is an easy language to learn? In some extent yes, but we must admit that literature written in English and mass media build up its strength all over the world. Owing to the latter, we actually acquire English and its omnipresence facilitates learning. American films and songs performed mostly in English have worked their way into the cultures of both post-communist and EEC countries. English is easy to learn in the free-market economy environment. Unlimited access to the variety of English textbooks, magazines, correspondence or interactive courses should please even those choosy or ' less-gifted ' learners .
