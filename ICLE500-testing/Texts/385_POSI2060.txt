Title: English is an easy language to learn 
 
Today, when English is one of the major languages in the world, it requires an effort of the imagination to realize that this is a relatively recent thing. In Shakespeare's times, for example, only a few million people spoke English, and the language was not thought to be very important by the other nations of Europe, and was unknown to the rest of the world .
Judging from the world statistics, which say that around 400 million people all over the world speak English and also relying on my own experiences throughout my learning years, I find English a language easy enough to be learned by every potential learner .
To start with, I would like to go into certain historical details to some extent, although the paper is not supposed to cover this area of language study in the first place. However, it is a pure fact that Old English, like modern German, French, Russian or Polish had many inflections to show singular and plural, tense, person, etc., but over the centuries, words have been simplified, which is a spectacular facilitation for the learners of English. As a result English verbs now have very few inflections, and adjectives do not change according to the noun, contrary to Polish, where the number of inflections and forms compared to those of English is unbelievably high. Thanks to the loss of inflections, English has become, over the past five centuries, a very flexible language. In relation to its flexibility and simplicity I would like to present some evidence .
Without inflections, the same word can operate as many different parts of speech thus facilitating vocabulary development .
Many nouns and verbs have the same form, (which in Polish never takes place) for example: swim, drink, walk, kiss, look and smile. We can talk about water to drink and to water the flowers; time to go and to time a race; a paper to read and to paper a bedroom. Another substantial simplification is that adjectives can be used as verbs, for example, we warm our hands in front of a fire; if clothes are dirtied, they need to be cleaned and dried. Prepositions too are flexible, e.g. a sixty-yerar old man is nearing retirement; we can talk about a round of golf, cars, or drinks. What's more, English is an incredibly open language for the admission of new words and easy creation of compounds and derivatives .
On the other hand there are many learners who believe English to be a very complicated language to master. Quite frequently, as a reason for such an opinion they mention the wide range of English tenses, which indeed may seem an obstacle at the early stages of learning. More to it, some learners hate the English pronunciation and spelling systems in which there is hardly any regularity .
However, in my opinion, these obstructions can be overcome easily through sufficient dose of practice .
Besides, I think that English shows absolute logic in its grammatical assumptions and although it is a Germanic language, it resembles Polish in many linguistic aspects .
One more important issue connected with English is its omnipresence in every branch of our lives and an exceptionally easy access to it, especially through mass-media .
English is the language of business, politics, sport and science nowadays .
However, its becoming a world language has not been merely due to its easiness and simplicity of form but also to its establishment as a mother tongue outside England, in all the continents of the world. Statistically, one person in seven of the world's entire population speaks English .
Surprisingly enough, 75 % of the world's mail and 60 % of the world's telephone calls are in English. Isn't it impressive?
Having presented all the facts and arguments I have had at my disposal I think I am not left alone with the opinion that the English language is not complex, in fact to me it is a pleasure to learn .
