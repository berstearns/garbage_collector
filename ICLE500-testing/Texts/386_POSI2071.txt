Title: English is an easy language to learn 
 
Why are some students successful at language learning while others are not?
Why is the foreign language sometimes easy for one group of people and difficult for the other at the same time?
People involved in language teaching often say that students who really want to learn will succeed whatever the circumstances in which they study. The biggest factor affecting their success is the motivation that students bring to class. Motivation is some kind of "internal drive" that encourages somebody to pursue a course of action .
If we perceive a goal and that goal is sufficiently attractive, we will be strongly motivated to do whatever is necessary to reach it. Language learners who are motivated perceive goals of various kinds; short-term goals and long-term goals .
In general, strongly motivated students with long-term goals probably learn easier than those who have no such goals .
Apart from the motivation, physical conditions have great effect on learning the foreign language (not necessarily English). When people get older their speech organs are stiffer. It would be much easier for children to develop pronunciation skill than for adults. In general, English is easily and willingly learned by children. It is very good for children to start learning English at the age of six or seven .
The English grammar rules are not very complicated, especially at the beginner's stage, so they are very easily learned by the students .
Success in learning English as a foreign language depends on the learner's nationality. It is very important what the learner's native language is. For Chinese, for example, English would be more difficult than for any other European because these two cultures, Chinese and English, are very distant. Germen, on the contrary, would be better learners at English because these two languages are not very distant (some words are even similar).
Although Polish grammar is different from English one, Polish students don't have bigger problems with understanding and acquiring the English rules .
English has a special position since it has become the international language of communication. It has become very fashionable as well. You can meet English everywhere: TV, radio, computers and even in the street .
Nowadays, especially in Poland, everything what comes from America is the best. When you go to the cinema you can see mostly an American film and hear real American accent, on the radio most songs are in English but not necessarily singing by an Englishman or an American. A lot of songs are written in English because they sound better and more people could understand them. English is present also in computers so if you want to operate the computer you have to know the language .
As I said English is present everywhere now because it has become extremely popular these days. Everybody wants to learn it and know it as it's the most fashionable language in the world. It sounds nice and it's easy to learn. If compared with any other language (Polish, for example) I must say that it's not complicated at all .
