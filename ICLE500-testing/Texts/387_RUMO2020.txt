Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 

The problem of the university degrees can be viewed differently. There are certainly some people who consider high education degree to be useless in the sense of its actual practical use. I myself do not agree with this statement. I think that education is one of the most important parts of our lives. It is the basis of the person's whole life. Education gives a person a better appreciation of such fields as art, literature, history, human relations, and science, it is intended to help young people indentify, choose and prepare for a career, it helps people enjoy richer, more meaningful lives. Unfortunately nowadays a great number of the universities appeared in our country that do not provide their students with the actual, valuable education, but I am rather optimistic as far as this situation is concerned. I think that such institutions will soon cease to exist being really useless .
The educational system is constantly changing. There are certainly quite a number of problems in this process, some questions have already been solved, others are still to be answered. By way of solving the problems the whole system is developing .
Historically universities developed from the cathedral and monastery schools. Their development took place so slowly that it is difficult to know the point at which they became universities. Thus, the first universities in Europe appeared in the 1100's or may be 1200's. Those universities provided the unified teaching of such disciplines as low, medicine, and theology and they were rather general than specilized. These courses were gradually broadened .
The point used as the title of the present essay perhaps had been discussed time and again by those people who were concerned with the educational system even in the 18th century. If we look closely at the historical development of the university education we will be able to see the reflection of the problem in question. To my mind, a growth of specialization reflects the point in question .
During the 1800 specialization in knowledge was increasing. Many Institutions were created to train students in such fields as agriculture, medicine, engineering, and commerce. Specialization also resulted in an increased emphasis on advanced study. Thus, education for professions overshadowed the liberal arts .
Now everything is changing the other way round. We can see another tendency: most of the educators agree that students need a broad education as a basis for whatever field attracts them .
From my point of view, this basic broad education should be humanitarian .
In our country in 1950's and also in 1970's technical specialization was of primary importance, but humanitarian education did not have any practical value. I do not mean to say of course that technology is not all important. I mean that the real scientists should have and do have broad education .
The word ' humanities' comes from Latin ' homo ' - ' human ' . Thus humanities study everything that is connected with the human beings, the most important facts in the development of the human civilization. This is the knowledge we should take into consideration!
