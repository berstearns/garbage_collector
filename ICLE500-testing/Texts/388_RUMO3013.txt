Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 

I believe it would be very interesting to muse upon the statement ' money is the root of all evil ' especially now. It seems to me that for our country this question is gradually becoming more and more urgent. And as for me I feel that now, at the age of 19, it somehow beings to touch me and my life also .
Of course money itself is not the root of all evil, but it is man's cupidity which was so strongly expressed in money and became in many cases the root of evil. It turned out to be that money to some extent was invented to carry out man's desires of accumulation. When it didn't exist nobody I think could even try to have, for example, 10 waggons instead of one. It becomes possible with money's appearance. Man begins to get money and wishes more. So he gets even more than he needs, he has enough to satisfy his vital requirements, but he wants more and justifies himself, rebuilding his requirements. He already begins to get money not for the sake of food, clothes, other things, but for the sake of money itself. This is really awful that there is never too much money. This thirst for money knows no bounds. In such situation man seems to be a rather pathetic creature, absolutely enslaved. He involves himself in a play, a neverending play, and stops to control it .
Let's look at the results of people's passion for money in the world. Those endless wars, numerous murders, betrayals, aspiration for authority are very often manifestations of this passion. For many centuries different states, republics and nations appear and dye, separate and unite because of little groups of people who want to get more money. In our everuday life there are so many quarrels, lack of understanding which lead to hostility and they are also the off-spring of this problem .
I'm not sure that money can make somebody happy. Wise man always spoke about it at all times. In Europe, in America people ( unfortunately they are few) often speak of the tragedy of human nature, of how it is terrible that materialistic values are considered now to be much higher than spiritual ones and so on and so forth. And it is very sad that Russia is eager to be like the West in many respects. Even spiritual goals seem to be an object of sale and purchase. They buy books with gold binding not to read but to demonstrate, disks of the classic music simply for having it. They make their children to study foreigh languages because it is prestigious, supposing rather naively that education also can be bought .
So unfortunately money really takes a very important, supreme part in our life. And we certainly can not talk about freedom in the world until we understand quite well how much evil depends on this role of money .
