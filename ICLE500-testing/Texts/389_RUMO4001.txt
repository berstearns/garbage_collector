Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
People get used to the achievement of civilisation very quickly. One can hardly imagine a modern apartment without a TVset, a radio or a telephone. Nobody understands how we had been able to live and communicate before these useful things were invented. I wonder if people felt the same when telephone first appeared. It was just a miracle: one didn't need to leave one's house and go somewhere. All one had to do is to take the receiver, to dial the number and to tell anything he or she wanted to convey. I am not against telephone at all, it makes life convenient and comfortable. It makes life easy, but in some sense it separates people, their relationships grow distant. Why to go to see your friends when you can always ring them up. As a result there are so many telephone friends now, when people don't see each other for years but call themselves close friends. I don't think it is a communication in the proper sense, it is just the illusion of it, an ersatz communication, so to speak .
Cinema brought to our life the idea of mass media. As a matter of fact, it doesn't separate people. On the contrary while watching a film one is overwhelmed with the feelings which most of the time are shared by the whole audience. An opinion poll has been conducted recently to find why people go to the cinema. The most common reason was to escape for a moment from this dreary life. Therefore we can say that cinema spreads two great illusions: illusion of living a more interesting and attractive life and illusion of collective or mass consciousness. But still cinema is not so powerful as television because people go to the cinema only occasionally. Television is a much more effective way to influence people's minds. We can say that it combines three features which have been mentioned above: illusion of living a better life, illusion of mass consciousness and illusion of communication. We have surrendered to its power, and now it plays a very important role as the centre of our life. What is the most common thing today? People come home, switch on their tv set and let it work for the rest of the evening. And at weekends, when films go one after another without any pause, they stay at home all day long. Television seems to be a sort of drug which we have grown addicted to. I think it would be useful to try and single out those characteristic features of television which distinguish it from other means of mass media. Unlike radio it appeals to our ability to see and to hear, its visual and aural impact on us is very strong. Unlike cinema which contains a personal attitude and presupposes a personal interpretation, television is neither artistic, nor personal. It uses words to put some idea into our heads depriving us of an opportunity to think in a different way. Therefore it may serve as an excellent means to rule a country as religion used to be, and it was realised in the Third Reich where television was turned into the official means of state propaganda and governmental control .
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that television as a product of progress brought some good things into our lives but there is hardly any need to mention them because they are familiar to everyone. I wanted to discuss only those negative features of television which may balance the positive ones and help to estimate objectively its role in our life .
