Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
So much chewing gum For the eyes .
(Small boy's definition of certain TV programs).
It would be great hypocrisy on my part to start putting on airs and say that I never indulge in such lowbrow activity as watching TV. Oh, shame on me, I can watch it from dawn till night when I have a day off. I remember, as a child I used to contemplate on what a horrible life must our poor ancestors have led who had no television, poor dears!
There is no point in denying that TV has become part and parcel of our everyday life. It is a feature of our civilisation and when it has ceased to exist our life will change .
We must give television credit for its educational programs, for example, I find TV language lessons very helpful. Then, isn't it wonderful to travel around the world without stirring a finger; to visit places and see things that we are dying to visit and see, but have very little chance of ever doing it: we can witness a volcano erupting; we can go down under the sea and watch sharks and octopus and what not; we can have a look at our planet bird's eye view or even from the outer space. All this feeds our imagination and convinces us that things we find in books really do exist .
Such a phenomenon as mass culture would hardly have existed without television. There can be varied opinions about mass culture, but we should admit that, a cheap and vulgar substitute though it can be, it is better than nothing at all. The highbrow may be irritated by some programs, but for some they may be the only source of information: television expands their knowledge of the world and enriches their vocabulary .
Addictive as it is, television rules our lives: we plan everything in accordance with the TV schedule. Vulgar as it may be, television forms our world-view: we see only those things that we are shown; if TV-makers consider something to be uninteresting for the largest part of viewership or simply not spectacular enough, than we will never learn of its existence .
What I dislike about television is that it not only does not encourage "ordinary folk" to use their little grey cells, but even makes them believe that the rest of the world is populated by their like. As Nathalie Sarraute put it: "Radio and television have succeeded in lifting the manufacture of banality out of the sphere of handicraft and placed it is that of a major industry". Television gives us all, so to speak, a set of common words and thoughts that we all share, and then it gives us the impression that everything else is heresy .
The mind of an ordinary person nowadays is crammed with facts and opinions and viewpoints, and very often they contradict each other. One may call it a "jig-saw puzzle" world-view where lots of pieces simply do not fit in. Nevertheless, this creates an illusion of a deep insight into everything: people do not understand that to know something does not mean to store everything one hears about it, but to form one's own idea about it. Names of famous writers and composers have become household names, but that does not mean that people have become more educated .
May be we, all of us, are poor TV-addicts and waste our time ogling into the flickering screens that slowly but steadily sap our intelligence, but still it is great to know that this great comforter, enlightener and entertainer is always with us, "for better for worse, in sickness and in health, till death us to part".
