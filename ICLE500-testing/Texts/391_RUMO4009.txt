Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The 20-th century... We can't but give it its due. From the very beginning up to the end this time represents a great progress of mankind in all fields. It is literally overwhelmed by discoveries, historical events that are really worth putting down in history. In fact all the preceding centuries' contribution in the development of man power is incomparably less than the one made during this particular period. There is no need to enumerate a great number of names of people who made it possible to fly into space, to have such a good helper as a personal computer, to create real miracles in the fields of chemistry, biology and many other sciences .
So the 20-th century... It is not over yet but in my estimation in advance of time limits. As is known the time influences upon a man, changes him. Nowadays this dependence is especially actual and obvious because the tempo of industrialisation of life is too fast. It penetrates into the most spheres of modern society. But a man never can be a robot, though sometimes he has to come up to this invisible edge between a man and a machine, but it is too dangerous. The point is that his brain is an open system, ready to imbibe everything new. Moreover there are some fields which will always remain vitally important. For instance - human relations. When there is a lack of them, a man gets tired of life much faster, and when such facts take place he may simply destroy himself, commit a SUICIDE.
That's why everything concerning human nature needs directly is sacred and inviolable. People engaged in the sphere of entertainment and show-business have always taken it into consideration. A man is the only being enjoying soul. This abstract notion, the poets sang the praise of for ages, is naughty and hard to predict. Nevertheless it is the main feature differing a man from animals .
Let us try to follow the flight of human fantasy. All the modern inventions and achievements were born in this super computer called human mind. When the civilisation were in rudimentary state and later at the feudal time imagination was the screen reflecting all human thoughts. In the beginning all the great things were nothing more than dreams. Some of them a man made come true, some still wait for their realisation. That's why dreaming is a necessary step in all undertakings. It represents a model, maybe a very primitive one but still no less important. Also dreaming, is like a vent that helps us to escape reality for a while. Every man has his own dreamland "but not everybody is eager to go a long way which begins in our mind. Only a rather lucky man manages to realise his ambitions, but "God helps them who help themselves". That's why strong will, and first of all, firm belief in our own dreamland is the key to survival in such a crazy world like ours .
