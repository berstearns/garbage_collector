Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Feminism is a phenomenon, which together with television, cinema, numerous flights into the space characterises our crazy 20th century .
Feminism, what is it actually? It is the struggle of women for their rights the dictionary informs us. So at first sight there is no harm in it. Let's have a brief look at the history of its development .
The end of the 19th century - women are bored and tired of sitting at home, knitting, washing , bringing their children up and waiting for their husbands who spend all their time at offices earning for the living. It is not a very cheerful picture, is it? And who will judge poor women for their innocent desire to vary their monotonous lives a little?
What do we observe now, just several decades later? Women study at universities together with men, they wear the same clothes, take an active part in politics, they go in for sports, they even fly into the space .
They are likely to have achieved everything they dreamed about .
But amazingly they do not stop. They dug deeper and found things which they called " discrimination " and " sexism".
A man opens a door before a woman and she is insulted. She can do it herself, she does not also let him pay for her at the restaurant. She earns enough to do it herself. There will be millions of such examples. And finally what do we have now? Men treat us as if we were men. They forgot what it is to be a gentleman .
The relations between men and women became simply like in the stone age. And when some women who are far from the idea of feminism try to protest men always have a ready answer: " But you wanted it yourselves " .
I think that the cause of feminism gave us, women, a lot, but today it has gone too far. There must not be extremes - that is a golden rule. Unfortunately feminists do not understand it , as they do not understand how ridiculous they and their ideas are .
" We are no worse than men. We want to have everything men have."
That's a phrase frequently used by them. And gradually they become like men: very rude and not elegant at all .
I don't know about the others, but I want to be a woman, and I want to feel in the presence of men. And I am absolutely sure that most of today's women do not want to have anything in common with today's feminists, who, probably, are establishing the 3rd class now .
So let them fight for their ideas, but don't let's us, women, be taken by them .
