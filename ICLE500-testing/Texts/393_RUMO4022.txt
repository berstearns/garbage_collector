Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
To begin with I should say that opium is a double-sided phenomenon: on the one hand it does irreparable harm, but on the other - strange it may sound-it helps people. We know perfectly well that opium serves as a basic component for various medicines .
I would like to observe the situation with the television from these absolutely opposite points of view. Let's begin with harmful things, as we usually prefer to do .
First of all, this awful "goggle-box" brings quarrels into families. The case is always the same. A wife wants to see a "soup opera", a husband at least doesn't want it, he usually prefers to have supper instead. Besides, he is interested in sports... A child enjoys watching cartoons. Tastes differ. And what will they do? The answer is very simple: they quarrel or... buy a new "one-eyed monster".
Yesterday, I saw a man on TV, he found a solution of the problem: he threw his TVset out of the window! He said that he could not bear it anymore, the TVset gained power over his whole family, in fact, there wasn't Family, anymore .
Oh, dear! We've completely forgotten that there are a lot of interesting things around us, we are so much involved with the television. Do you remember, when you wrote letters to your friends and relatives or when you heard from them? I'm quite surprised by the number of people around me who simply cannot write letters (in the proper sense of the word). How often I hear: "I'm watching a very interesting program, don't bother me now, please, or phone me later". But if I am depressed, I need help and advice immediately?! TV-monster takes my friends away. It offers them simple pleasures and everything that I can't do. Of course, it is simpler to switch the TVset on, sit comfortably in an arm-chair and enjoy, than to go hiking, reading, visiting friends or even going to the theatre .
"Television replaces parents!" "Television makes us foolish!" "It demands and obtains total attention!"
All right... But let's ask ourselves: "If it is so harmful and awful, why do we go on watching it?"
The fact is, television gives us enormous opportunities to learn a lot about the world, ways of living in various countries. We are able even to learn foreign languages with the help of it. As time goes on, there appear many interesting and useful programs for children and adults, teens and old people. And all those entertaining shows help us to relax after our hard day. It also unites a family. I guess, people like to gather together in the evening, maybe at the dinner, and to watch a family program. The whole family also can take part in TV games .
So, the TV problem is very complicated and we cannot either praise or curse television. I think, everything depends on ourselves. And don't forget, television is opium. How to use it, in what cases and in what doses, that is the question .
