Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
We have to face the fact that feminists have caused a lot of harm both to the society and the women's liberation movement, to the whole idea of women's liberation .
First and foremost, we should try to understand how it happened that men and women had found themselves "on the two separate sides of the fence". It seems to me that it is all due to feminists .
Feminists believe that they fight for equal opportunities with men. But what have they managed to achieve since they began fighting?
Men smile widely when they are asked to respect women's aspiration to have the same jobs and wages as they do. Because of the feminists' behaviour and their tricks men regard the idea of women's liberation as a very amusing one - and nothing more .
Men do not seem to think much of women's abilities. May be, that is because they see only funny nervous persons, who are not satisfied with the way they live, and these strange persons fight for women's rights. Many of those, who call themselves feminists are rude and fussy, and they do not have the slightest idea of real feminism, which is always "pure and never simple". But what we see now, is just a simplification of feminism .
Let's look into the matter of the feminists' "achievements" now .
Women all over the world can get any job - if they work hard .
It is not true in all the cases, but in many cases it is true. But if a woman managed to get a good job it is very often due to a man, who has hired her, helped her and who has let her dreams come true, because men are not as cruel and stupid as feminists consider them to be. And what is more, men are always glad to let women be equal to them as far as the question who will pay a bill in a restaurant is concerned. There are the cases when men spoiled by feminists, invite women to a restaurant, eat and disappear in order to give women a chance to be equal with them. Men who give seats to women in a bus died out like dinosaurs. They even are afraid of looking ridiculous and their motto is "To die, but not to give up". This is all fruit of many years labour of feminists. Who could imagine such situations a century ago, when there were not so many people involved into the movement! But I would like to return to feminists' "achievements". As we all know now, feminists hate compliments and hate people paying them compliments. And now we are told pleasant things more and more seldom . "Haven't you noticed any thing? I have had my hair cut! - Oh, do not worry, your hair will grow again soon". Such conversations have become part and parcel of our associating with men. But they adore to give us some pieces of advice, like: "You'd better go in for sports - I don't want you to put on weight", etc. I can't tell anything about feminists, but I believe, many ordinary women prefer being payed compliments - and they are fed up of such advice .
Men consider women to be equal with them but not in the cases we would like them to do. Men who have listened to feminists' speeches on TV, on the radio for a long time cannot treat women like princesses, but only like good chaps .
And another important point is to be made: those women, who really want to be equal with men don't speak about it too much and never make so much fuss about it, because they just do not have enough time. They abandon themselves to work and do their best to work as men do and even better, to achieve the results the men achieve. And they do not attract others' attention by their strange actions. That is all because they know: who but feminists assured men of their being stronger than women, although feminists wanted to do the reverse. It were feminists to build this fence between men and women by talking about it all the time .
