Some people say , that in our modern world , dominated by science , technology and industrialisation , there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination .
I am disagree with such opinion . From my point of view , nothing can prevent a person , who has imagination , to use it . I would like to mention , that any idea or invention , even in the sphere of science and technology is a product of one's imagination .
But even if we will not take everything , concerning science into account , there is a great field for one's creative activity and thinking .
For example , it is difficult to look clearly at 20th century and see it as people will a hundred years after our days . We are still too close to it .
The imagination of the painters of 20th century gave lifes to many interesting ideas by means of their works : cubists (Publo Picasso and Georges Braque) tried to show their subjects as though they could be seen from several points at the same time . All the different planes shown made them look as though they were composed of little cubes . The Cubists also rejected the Impressionist colours and worked mainly in browns and greys . Picasso's painting continued to change and develope after his Cubist phase .
The growing science of phisiology was largely responsible for the movement in art called Surrealism . The works of Freud at the beggining of the century was echoed in the paintings of Max Ernst .
The Expressionist painters , beginning with Van Gogh , needed to express their personal reactions to the confusing world around them , their personal dreams . If to speak of Marc Chagal's paintings , I would say that they are dream-like . I would even better call them ' fantasies' , not paintings .
So , in our modern world we can find a lot of gifted people .
For example , people used , use and will use their imagination and their dreams in music : not only when composing it , but also when listening to it . Igor Stravinsky , Sergei Procofiev , Dmitriy Shostakovich , Maurrice Ravel and many others - they did not simply use their dreams in their works . Each of their works was a Dream itself .
Some composers of our age have become interested in entirely new ways of creating sounds , for example , by the use of electronics . Some have even had music programmed by computers , which raised the question of whether or not it is truely creative work , and therefore true art . But I think , that any piece of music has inside it a piece of one's soul ; the perfect set of sounds does not have it , when it is composed by some electronics . Music is a kind of communication between souls ; even the most ' clever ' computer does not have one .
The same is with ballet or any other kind of dancing . There is to be a kind of communication between the souls of people . Every movement of dancer's hand , leg , even of his or her eyes are very important . It can not be done by computer ; soulless machine can not make people cry or laugh . Some dancers , such as Rudolf Nuriev , have a power over people . That is because he had a great imagination : he did not act during his dance - he lived .
So I am sure , that there is every chance that in 2041 theatergoers will be enjoying an authentic production of ' Giselle ' to celebrate its 200th birthday .
The world of art is closely connected with imagination , because without it art is impossible . Art is the making or doing almost everything , which depends on a degree of personal skill and talent . In this way judo , riding a bicycle , swimming or making model aircraft might each be thought of as an art .
In order to paint a picture , or carve an image out of stone , or compose a music work , the artist needs to be able to see what he is doing . Each human being has his own view on the world around him .
I feel sorry about the people , who think m, that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world . It means , from my point of view , that they do non have any imagination at all . Pity things !
