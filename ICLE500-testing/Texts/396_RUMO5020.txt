Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money and its role in lives of people is not an obvious question. One should consider all pros and contras before making a judgement on any subject, especially on such a controversial one as money .
Not only money but often lack of it may be "a root of evil". Money may give independence and power, lack of it constricts and limits. Certainly, there is a question of how the power given by money would be used in every particular case, but this largely depends on the person in possession of power and not on some intrinsic characteristics of money itself .
Poverty very often means dependence and limited opportunities for self expression. The great artists who suffers from it is a tragedy: a famous example is Paul Gauguin who had to dissolve the paint of his paintings when he needed some extra canvas that he could not afford to buy. Pablo Picasso, when he was young and unknown, burnt his drawings in the fireplace to heat the room as he had no money to buy coal for it. Salvador Dali said that an artist must be rich to be independent, because independence is an indispensable condition of creative work .
It perhaps should be regretted that the human world is made so dependent on money and the wealthy, nevertheless very few can neglect its cruel rules, virtually no one could ever escape it .
Money stratifies the modern society, it protects those who have it and hampers the way up of those who don't, the world cannot favour and salute everyone, Somme has to lose. The winners only have to quiet the losers to preserve their positions - this is usually called "to maintain social stability".
This world is a world of possession, property may destroy human relationships - relatives quarrel over inheritance, friendship ends because of arguments over debts - these are common plots both in literature and in reality. And very often poor people are the most cruel and unmerciful in this eternal fight for property .
It does not imply, of course, that wealthy people are generally kinder or more humane than their unfortunate neighbours. But they often have better chances to be kinder, as they have a lot themselves, they may be too lazy sometimes to fight for an extra piece of other people's possessions. They even can often afford charity - this elegant way of making one proud of oneself .
A risk that no one can be secured against is "money addiction". Money addicts are eager to use any means to obtain more and more money, they simply cannot stop doing it, especially as so many temptations are put in one's way .
Poor people can commit crimes because of money as well. There are terrifying stories in this country about desperate people who, having not been given their wages for years, are driven to crimes - for example, a man who attempted to burn himself in the accounts-department of the plant he was working in, though innocent people were victims of this accident, other workers did not blame him - having been in the same conditions they understood what made him to do this terrible thing .
"Poverty is a vice" - one of the Dostoevsky's characters argues. Perhaps, it is not a vice by itself, but many other vices originate from it - envy, hatred, greed. Envy and greed are one of the strongest motives that guide humans .
Still money can play positive role in a human's life, it helps to get a good education, and therefore quite often to find a good job. Possession of money very often improves one's character and maintains one's calmness and personal integrity .
The utopian wish I am thinking of is that people could have money and at the same moment not lose their heads because of it .
