Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Everyone of us, I believe, at least once in his life asked himself, or had been asked, about the role money plays in his/her life. I doubt, whether there would be many people who would honestly answer, that they do not care much about money and say, that it brings only sorrow .
We must admit, of course, that history remembers quite a lot of terrible crimes that were committed because of money. People assured themselves that money would make them happy and powerful, and they were not afraid to kill or to steal, in order to get it. Blood flowed, people were dying, towns and even countries had been destroyed, and of course, that bloody money could not bring much happiness to its owners .
But how much good properly used money can bring! I think, now we are becoming wiser about it, although we can not deny that crimes are still being committed. But we must think, what our lives would be like without money? Would the children be able to get proper education? Would the patients be well-treated? Would we be able to enjoy our lives fully?
We also can not deny that in our age of industry, technology and progress we can not do without money which play a vital role in our existence, especially recently, when we have got an opportunity to live our lives as we want .
Some people tend to say, that to think always about how to gain more money is too materialistic, but, to tell the truth, how can we otherwise survive? We have to, I think, face the fact, that we live in the country, where we can not be sure about our future, when we do not know, what is going to happen with us tomorrow - that is why we have to secure ourselves. I do not mean to say, of course, that only money must be our final aim, it is not the only thing one should be ruled by. Its importance and power must be limited, so that it would not turn into an idol, that kills and brings evil .
But if we have a look at all those poor people, pensioners, abandoned children in orphanages, we will see, that their main misfortune-the problem, that is being talked about for so long, is lack of money. Unfortunately, a wish to help is not always enough to solve these painful matter .
We switch on the TV or radio and is it that we hear? We hear that this or that branch of science or industry is lacking money, the institutes, plants are on the edge of collapse, because they do not know where to collapse, because they do not know where to collapse, because they do not know where to find the means to survive .
So how then can money be the root of all evil, if almost everyone can not dispense with it, if it can, and does bring good .
The only thing, that is very often turns to be difficult, is to be able to stop when its needed and do not cross the border of what is permitted. Everything is, actually, in our hands. In is only in our power whether to make money either the source of sorrow and blood, or welfare and pleasure. It's not money that brings in evil; evil had always been brought in by people's lack of restrain and crave for profit. So isn't that a reason to think about ourselves? For in good hands even what before was brought only by sorrow can serve to good .
