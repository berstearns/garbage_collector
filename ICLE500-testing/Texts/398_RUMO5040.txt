Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
The problem of education is one of the greatest interest and importance which recently has been touched upon. It concerns practically everyone. Two thirds of people think of university education; every year there is increadible competition to all universities, but the question which is bound to arise in this connection whether all these people ( both parents and future students) realize the aim of the university studies and the process of it. Everybody wants to enter one of those so-called prestigious faculties bearing in mind the idea of as if it is really possible for a student graduated from one of these departements to have enough knowledge to occupy the ' prestigeous' place in life. But none of the first year students could explane the real goal of his studies in university and the value of his future degree .
So first year students recieve plenty of information which may seem useless because it is so difficult, there are a lot of new terms, notions which are supposed to cover practically the whole sphere of his future studies. And then in further years he just gets a deeper knowledge in a sphere. A student begins to specialize in this or that sphere so that the number of subjects introduced in last year of studies is much less as compare to the first year. And sometimes he is specialized in a subject which may not be connected with his future work ' in the real world'.
Frankly speaking only 25 per cent of the whole amount of information which students recieve in university may be useful to him in future life in the case that he would be going to work in the sphere of his profession .
But here and there they speak of the changes which have already taken place or which should be adduced in order to reform our system of higher education, to make it more practical and useful. And of course every modern programms and systems of education which are presented on all levels ( from the secondary education to the level of university studies) are innovations which are to be praized. But we should distinguish between university education and all other kinds of educations which are offered by colleges, special courses etc .
A person who wants only narrow special knowledge ( instead of university ' universal ' one ) in any sphere to work at should choose not the university but some college or courses which offer a number of practical abilities and skills for a particular trend of business. But if a person chooses the university level of education itpresupposes his readiness to the universal number of subjects he is going to study and his ability to acquire this amount of information or even more if he is particularly interested in some subject. And one more remark it is so difficult to find a job for a narrow specialist .
In this connection I want to remember the words of Kozma Prutkov who said that " specialist is like a gumboil - his developement is one-sided". It seems to me that all professors who write educational programms think of it and decided to give a student as much information as possible - so they try to make the university programm really unversal. Thus the great amount of information recieved on university lectures and seminars forms a general cultural background which helps a student of linguistics with university degree to communicate more or less freely within some other spheres of science. The information in adjoined spheres may help to solve problems and make conclusions in special sphere .
Probably one more reason which can refute the pragmatic approach to university education it is one of interest. The interest matter is obviously important when we speak of a student devoted to the subject a sphere of science he is going to dedicate his life. Then such kind of student begins to acquire knowledge in history of the sphere, the present state of the art, the existing ideas of further developement. Thus he gradually becomes aware of the subject so that he can work in every sphere connected with his profession. And this approach of ' wide ' education is commonly shared in this country which occupies one of the first places in the world scale of higher education .
Therefore we can't speak of uselessness of university theoretical education and degrees which are so hard to achieve but by all means are worth to be achieved .
