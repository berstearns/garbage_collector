Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
It is by and large assumed that the university degrees are teoretical and have nothing to do with the real world. If we ask our graduate acquantancies about their jobs many of them would probably say that they have not obtained the work they would like to have. It occurs that a more prestigious post is occupied by a less educated person who may be not as much educated as you are but works better because he/she is more experienced. On may come across a great number of adver - tisments where there is need for a person qualified and expe - rienced in a particular area of work activity. Why is it so?
The answer is clear and simple. The theoretical course needs practice .
I would like to illustrate the point referring to my own studies. I am learning at the English Department of the philological faculty, so I am to know all important items of English, in other wards I'll know the language theoretically although I am tought to speak, write and read properly. My knowledge of English is necessary to continue my study as a postgraduate but I don't really think the knowledge of all pe - culiarities of the language can be of any use at a place which has nothing to do with theoretical study of the language .
- I would like to clarify the diffrence between theory and practice. Theoretical studies are based on practice, theory actually analyzes and systematizes data of practice. For ins - tance, we are studing the history of English. As a material we have a number of Old and Middle English texts that are acts of speech in other words practice of language. Researchers nor - mally create their own theories analyzing, generalizing and systematizing these texts. Another example of the kind con - cerns sundry dictionaries of modern English .
Based on the current use of language, they are to fix all kinds of changes appearing in the language. But there is hard - ly a theory that can cover all peculiarities of the daily lan - guage use. Theory is, generalizing an object of study, to form a certain idea of a particular object. So I think, that prac - tice is primary and theory is secondary .
At a university one studies a number of theoretical subjects, he/she gets the idea of what he/she may do when wor - king. But as prince Charles once said; ' to think about doing so is one thing but to actually get up and do it is another matter altogether'. So I think that one should check one's knowledge by mere practice .
