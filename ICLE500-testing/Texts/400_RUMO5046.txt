Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
There have been so many changes in economic, social and political life in Russia in the 1980s. Nowdays there many different political parties instead of the only Communist Parny that has existed for 70 years in this country. The privatisation of the 1990s promoted the appearance of people owning shares in companies. Many people preter working for themselves and not as employees. All these changes are not enough to prevent the growth of unemployment and strikes .
So the Government's first priorities are to improve the economic situation, to curb inflation, to reduce taxes and ...
to forget about public expenditure .
I mean that the government is so slow in building up its role in educeation. At the same time in much of our public diseussions it seems taken for granted that certain essencial changes in educational system of Russia are the urgency .
Is it true or not ? It is not simple to answer this question, because there is a world of difference between the situation in education nowadays and in the past, between the situation in liberal education and technical one .
It has been assumed for many years that to enter the university, to graduate from it, to complete the university degree are the things of great value and have a lot of prestige. At present it is very easy to aim at all these things if you havt a lot of money. Furthermore, having a university degree doesn't guarantee that a person will have a good well-paid and interesting job. So many young people enter the university in order to get diploma, to show it to the parents and relatives and to begin finding a job having no connexion with his or her profession .
One more important point connected with the necessity to change the educational system of Russia is the sharp deterioration of the high standards of the education in polytechnics and technical colleges. It does'n need any proof that the Soviet engineers just after graduating from polytechnics have been able to work properly and without many difficulties in any branch of industry. But in the course of time equipment of the laboratory become obsolete and the is no money to buy new and modern one. These students having perfect knowledge of their subjects are unable, therefor, to find a job and, moreover, they can't work. In my opinion, the best way to improve this situation is for the state to realise clearly that without well-prepared specialists this country is doomed to destruction .
But the general liberal education of Russia is on the verge of completely distruction. This state has no funds for the essential purposes. There is no money for the lingvistic laboratories, no money for new books, no money for holding seientific conferences, no money for publishing books by L. Tolstoy or A. Chekhov. And the commonplace retorts to these statements are: how can you tell about money for publishing jubilee edition of the works of Bunin when many people have nothing to eat ? But that's nonsense !
One more question connected with liberal education in this contry is: does this state really need in such a number of linguists, specialists in literature, historians and writhers!
That is the question of great importance for me as for a person whose profession is the language and literature .
With the industrial and scientific revolution it has come about that to live and work well, to be at home in this new world of ours, we need to have an education which is limited neither to the know-how of our jobs nor to our duties of citizenship. Our education should let as to make money that we need for life and assist in achieving certain self - - satisfaction. Unfortunately, our university degrees don't promote these aims .
For example, now I'm a third-year student of the one the most prestigeous universities in the world. I'm a student of Moscow State University. I'm fond of reading books and discussing them with my friends. I admire my teachers, the size and deepness of their knowledge .
But at the same time I clearly realize that I'm unable to create any remarkable research, or to write an interesting book, or to work as a teacher at school. I have no skills for practical work. And I believe that not only me, but many my colleagies try to solve this dilemma - to have interesting buainess without much money or to begin to work in order to make money and to have high living conditions .
