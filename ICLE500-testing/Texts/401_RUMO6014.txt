Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Life of the young in an over-industrialized world is fool of unexpected turns .
New ideas come our way practically at every step, and very often dominate our young nimble minds and seem to have a life of their own. Thus, integrating into the world of new technologies and new ideas has ceased to be a challenge for the happy few. It is now a full-time job, for those who are on the alert to find their road in life. It would not do you any good to live the life of a maverick with books and theories crouching over you. On the other hand plunging into this world of modern life might be no less harmful both for your identity and your health. The world of reality and the world of make - believe are to coexist peacefully if not in perfect harmony. If you ask me, I think life is to be enjoyed. After all, what is the idea of spending your green years in the subdued excellence of libraries and reading halls unless you can at last hope to enjoy. Enjoying a thought relishing it, testing it for depth and exploring its modern application is what university student is to make his primary goal in life. Is it not the world of make-believe? Or is this life of human thought put against day-to-day formalities of existence ? I wonder .
Some people think that life is like a good book. The further you get into it the more it begins to make sense. I think it is a very rich idea and most stimulating as a motivation. Us, being the writers of our lives, the chance of starting a new chapter does not present itself more often than one would wish .
Checking on the mistakes in something we have written takes most of our life leaving a spacious room for improvement on the one hand and a slight chance for saying something outrageously original on the other .
What do we come into our professional life for ? To take in the knowledge of the past, to touch upon the masterful perfection of the present and, perhaps, to aspire for the enchanted afar. Is not it dreaming ? I am convinced it is so even if you have to stare at the world with wide-open eyes of exited disbelieve . " What is this life, if full of care we have no time to stand and stare..." - this allusion to the famous poem seems to be very much to the point in language study, since language in its primary oral form is nothing more than a diachronic bridge between generations of people and universe. The firmer your bridge is, the better chance you stand of not falling behind the overwhelming process of evolution of human thought .
The pace of life quickens daily. Thus, being too realistic about keeping track of the latest achievement of humanity in whatever sphere you take up is not very promising. The world of make-believe is of unsurpassed value. It takes the load off your mind, makes you wonder, protects you against the destroying effects of selfcriticism and inspires you with a romantic zest for selfperfection. The world of make-believe is ideal, it is devoid of imperfect things. Sometimes it is like peering at a crystal ball in the hope of making Santa Claus fulfil your wish .
The good thing about dreaming is that occasionally dreams do come true, and a dreamer like no other person is eager to share the goal with all those busking in his friendship and devotion. A dreamer is definitely a better person than a dry moralist - inquisitive, easily exerted and genuinely grateful .
