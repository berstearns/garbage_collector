Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
A good part of our ' war between the sexes' - and consequently much of what we identify as ' the problems of society and civilization today', is due to our evolution of rationales in which the relative non-evolution of our basic reproductive cycle has not been assimilated. Quite simply, it does not appear to have been the nature of evolution to have ' much improved ' our basic reproductive mechanism over that of early mankind, a cycle in which ' pubescent, little pro-hominid boys impregnated fecund, little pro-hominid girls' as soon as possible (essentially anthropoid-ape age), and ' little men', consequently, supported and protected nurturing ' little mothers' until their progeny were themselves able to propagate . -In a hypothetically primitive framework for ' now sapiens', this basic cycle of organism-viability might be of no less than 16 and no more than 28 years length .
The evolution of ' pro-hominid cerebration ' on the other hand, took ' den ' congregation into coalescings of primitive society thru which, eventually, such ' primitive, vertebrate breeding ' was itself superceded under increasingly deliberative but still survival-of-the-fittest, pecking-order-based ' rationale'. This evolution (eventually ' knowledge ' - science and technology), is synonymous that of ' facilitating organism viability ' and extending life-span/physiology therein in a way which increasingly subordinated that primitive reproductive cycle to societal and civilizational ' advances' - both men and women eventually eschewing child-bearing past early thirties; women, further (especially mothers), of interest in sex reducing into menopause and terminating thereafter, but men - disparately, of ' primitive ' drive essentially continuing into likewise increasing old age . -There is no mystery in the eventually formal institutionalization of polygamy, the whole of ' the war between the sexes' really taking off after the industrial revolution .
What has evolved is a period of singularly human-kind, post-'critical reproduction ' time, essentially that between ' primitive-man parenting complete ' (24 to 28 years of age) and present-day ' old age', the occupation and substance of which has been more or less circumstantially conjured into existence out of that only vehicle of all vertebrate supercession - survival-of-the-fittest pecking order diasporating into its configuration space. Consequences of this out-distancing of progenitive mechanism by our unique deliberative capability, it must be observed - democracy, free enterprise and economic policy for example, have nothing whatsoever to do with ethics, religion, human rights and other such nonsense thru which we justify their existence and manipulation. Our ' deliberative capability', in effect, has yet to include assimilation of this quite natural divergence so critically underlying ' the human phenomenon and all things human'.
