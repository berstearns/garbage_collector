Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
I beleive this statement is completely untrue. Feminists have done a lot to the cause of women. Indeed there have always been organisations of women compaigning to promote women's interests in society .
Feminists concentrated on gaining access for women to education, employment and political interests. Feminism is concerned with ending legal discrimination against women and removing all barriers which prevent their entry into the public spheres on equal terms with men. During last four decades of the nineteenth century a series of campaigns emerged to improve women's legal and economic position .
Feminists have pressed for public policies to outlaw discrimination against women - both direct discrimination such as paying a woman less than a man doing the same job and indirect discrimination such as attaching unnecessary conditions to a job which will have the effect of excluding a woman. Feminists try to gain access for women to the rights , activities and responsibilities commonly available to men and to be "let in" to full participation in all areas of society as it currently exists .
Prevailing cultural norm used to require women to subordinate their active and creative needs to conform to a housewife role . As a result , stay-at home women felt empty and dissatisfied , tired and depressed .
There used to be sexual division of labour in the home , which designated the male as a breadwinner and his wife as economically dependent on him and responsible only for child care and housework .
This role left them fill rather isolated and low status. Moreover , women's dependent economic status gave men full control over the allocation of money within the home , and this often resulted in women not receiving the necessary benefits of men's wages. Such situation could spoil the relations within the family completely .
But now , because of women's movement, the situation has changed .
The employment of women, their ability to get a higher paid jobs affects the power structure of the family. A woman is no longer dominated by man , dependent on him , since their recources are equalized. Thus , a working wife's husband listens to her more , and she listens to herself more. She expresses herself and has more opinions. Instead of looking up into her husband's eyes and worshipping him ( what can make him a complete tyran ) , she levels with him , what makes him respect her. That doesn't certainly mean that a woman necessarily must devote her whole life to career - on the contrary , many feminists glorified her role as a mother. She just must have an opportunity to do both - her career and her housework. And I think , women's position in the public spheres of work and politics can not be viewed in isolation from their role in private sphere of home and family .
Still I beleive feminists must continue their struggle. There are still areas of professional work where women are grossly underrepresented .
Economic growth have improved women's material position , but many still experience poverty and their standard of living tends to be lower on average than men's - so , the goal of financial independence for women is not completely won. The questions arise naturally : Why women play such comparatively a small role in politics ? Why are low paid workers predominently women and high-paid professionals and managers mainly men ? So, as we can see , men as a group still gain a privileged position in society .
I also beleive that the political emergence of women acting consciously against domination by men is not just activiation of a new interest group. It's a historical event which holds the promise of enabling a more complete challenge of domination than has ever been possible before. Feminists' campaign have a long-term goal of transforming all relationships of domination and subordination in society .
