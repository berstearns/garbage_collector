Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Television - new religion ?
The twentieth century is inconceivable without television .
Almost every family in the world has a television set. There are TV sets in cafes and bars, schools and universities, in hospitals, banks and airports. Television is a universal source of information. People can study and travel with the help of television, it informs us of current affairs home and abroad and of course television is a good means of relaxation .
TV has become a new kind of art. Directors and cameramen have to work a lot to create a good show. Different special effects are used to make it more exciting and sometimes frightenning. But among hundreds of programmes only few are really popular with the vewers. Some showmen and newscasters are not inferior to singers and actors in their popularity .
I am not sure if it is possible to call television a new relegion but it goes without saying that millions of people adore it. Some of them do not only watch TV, they also come to TV studioes and take part in their favourite programmes and chat-shows, they want to talk to TV- stars and to get their autographs .
Besides television plays an important part in the popularization of sports. It gives sport fans an opportunity to watch different competitions and matches at home if they can not buy tickets or just have no time to go to a match they would like to see. Top models and popular sportswomen perform their shaping programmes on TV and women can work at their bodies together with them .
Plenty of soap operas are being shown on television now and most women , especially housewives enjoy them immensely. They try not to miss a single part, they discuss the troubles of the characters and take them close to heart.I think there are some funny and touching soap operas but in most cases they are boring because they are very often alike .
A large number of programmes are designed for children. Playgrounds usually become deserted when animated cartoons or other programmes for children are on. There are a lot of wonderful and touching ones and small boys and girls and even grown ups watch them with great pleasure .
Unfortunatelly in Russia television is usually the only amusement invalids and bed-ridden people can afford. They are the most regular viewers of TV programmes.I think it is an important merit of televisoin .
But of course television has its own drawbacks. It seems to me that there are too many programes devoted to politics. We should be informed of current affairs but in our country people have to face so many problems and they want to forget about them at least for a time. But it is impossible if every minute you are told about crimes and political problems .
I also think that too much violence is shown on the screen and there is violence even in cartoons for children. Some of them are about wars and fights and robberies. Meanwhile children watch many hours of television and it has great influence on them, besides children are inclined to imitate the characters they see on the screen and I would not like it if my younger sister became as cruel as some of them are .
People complain there are too many advertisments in between the programmes . Advitisihg campains bring in great profit to businessmen and I do not think angry viewers can help it. Anyhow there is something they can do about it-just turn their TV sets down not to hear primitive slogans .
I think television may be compared with religion and of course there is some resemblance. As any religion TV has its detractors and people who adore it and even fanatics. The former never turn their TV sets on if they have any while the latter watch TV night and day, try to persue TV and film stars, get nervous when advertisments last too long and know the TV - guide almost by heart.I am sure that both go to extremes .
To my mind television is just a kind of amusement ,a way of relaxation. It is an invention which gives us possibility to broaden our horizons makes our life more interesting. But it should not be opium or a religion which would let us escape from reality or have great influence on us. As far as believers are concerned I do not think television can substitute for their religion or church services.I am sure that neither TV nor computer and "Internet" or any other achievments of science and engineering are a good substitute for reading communicating, love or religion .
