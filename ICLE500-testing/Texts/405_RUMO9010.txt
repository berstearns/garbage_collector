Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money, money, money... What is money? Money is health, money is pleasure. Money is education, delight, happiness, life. Money is envy, crime. Money is death... So, money is everything. All we have we have for money. If we have money we have everything. But should we have everything? That is the question. The more we have the more we want to have .
Do you want to be rich? - Yes, you do. If you said ' ' no ' ' I just wouldn't believe you .
And even if you said to your wife that you don't want to make a fortune your wife would kill you , I assure you. And what do you do to get some money? I'd like to quote a few words from a song: " I work all night I work all day To pay the bills I have to pay - Isn't it sad?
And still there never seems to be A single penny left for me - That's too bad! "
Don't you feel the same? You get up before darn and your working day has already begun. You spend the whole day working until absolutely worn out to go out anywhere or to enjoy your family life you fall asleep in an arm chare before your TV set. So you work from dawn till night day after day, week after week and so on , so forth. But what for?
A man's wife watches TV admiring the beautiful life shown in films. And she demands that her husband should work less , pay more attention to her and his children and still he should bring more money. Then he begins to understand that his life is unbearable. His life becomes a torture and... he commits suicide .
But let's talk more seriously. Money is the root of all evil. Do you remember the war in Chechnya? How many people died during that war! A great number of young innocent men, women, children were victims in the hands of our government. The leaders of our country made a pile by sacrificing their own people. And you know that most of the wars broke out because someone wanted to conquer new territories, nations and become the greatest in the word .
Vanity, the wish to have power, money, push a man to destroy the life of other people. For example lets speak about drug tradesmen. They make people their slaves .
For a grate sum of money a man allows himself to induce another person to lead a pitiable existence, to turn the other's life to dreadful torture. And what about drug addicts? They feel drug-made delight, pleasure, joyfulness for a few hours and they go to rob or even kill innocent people to get some money which they will pay for rotten drugs in order to forget the cruel world in their false dreams .
People steal information from each other. Then they sell it. And it doesn't matter to them why others buy that information and what they are going to do with it .
A lot of our sportsmen emigrated to the countries where they could make more money. They sell themselves, they sell their motherland. Isn't it sad?
We are the slaves of money. Even if we had fair money and we could enjoy them Could be proud of them, could we be happy knowing that other people suffer?
Money is the root of all evil. But we have no power to change it. People are too imperfect to live without money. We live for ourselves. It's against our nature. Do you remember the dream about socialism where all people are equal? To build that world was a great mistake for us .
Our vanity push us to struggle for a place under the sun. But isn't it the law of nature?
Don't animals struggle for their life? Of course animals have no money. But people are more complicated creatures than animals. So we invent end money. Animals struggle for their life without money and people struggle with the help of them .
So, what is money? Is it the way of our existence? Money seems to be the root of our rotten life full of cruelty and evil. But history knows the examples or it's better to say attempts of building society without money. They were all a crash. Then maybe the root of all evil is human nature, not money?
