Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
To say the truth it took me much time to think over this state - ment, mayby because in our country the problem of feminism is not so popular as in Europe or in the USA. It happens that it is accepted to suppose that after the Great October Socialist Revolution men and wo - men are equal in their rights. And it was really like that. With the 20ies we were in the era of the "emancipated" woman. The had the vote .
She also had short hair and lipstick. Young women with jobs did not have to marry the first man who asked them. There were also protests over inequities of jobs and wages and there was a hard-fought battle paralleling the current strugle for abortion reform over birth cont - rol. Then it was the War which drew women into industry and for the first time in history into the armed forces on a par with men. As for the present I am a woman and I do not feel any infringement of my rights only becaus I am a womam. As for the civilized countries I think it is just the same: women are challenging and overturning the status quo in all fields from politics and business to sports and me - dicine, reshaping and recasting the social, political and economic trends of the day. Now the statementthat all that the women wish to have must come through a single channel and single choice: wealth, po - wer, social distinction, fame and even home and happiness, reputation, ease and pleasure, their bread and butter - all must come to them thro - ugh a small gold ring - is really out of date and unpopular. In this case if a woman can be elected to higher office, can occupy top corpo - rate posts and own successful business she can do whatever she wants and she has the equal rights with men, I do not see any reasons for feminists to be indignant. So if we are talking about the present I do not think the feminism has done either harm or good, but if we are talking about the feminism in the historical aspect I am just sure that it has done only good. Let's look at the social image of women in the last several generations. The first thing we discover is that the scholary historians who deride the idea of a special history of women are quite correct. Women have not been trend-setters, activists in the drama of great events. If they turn up in the middle of some climalic scene they are likely to have got there by the accident of marriage or occasionally of birth. Women-monarches have inherited power under laws made by men, not laid hands on it themselves. The history of women has not been made within their own ranks but has followed from the ma - le-initiated proced. Women's history is fragmented, interrupted; a shadow history of human beings whose existence has been shaped by the efforts and the demands of othere. As for the fight of women for their rights it involved more then a struggle for tangible goals like equal pay, equal opportunity, the vote it self. It was a fight for the very right to fight, to declare that one's ambitions and needs are as im - portent as those of men. Women were so isolated that the world could practically run without them exept for their services as domestic drudges. Millions of women knew from their own experience that "equal rights for women" was a phrase but not a fact. The women's movement was a search for a more honorable and worthy life. Yes it "was" and maybe now it is just the time to stop the search and look around, may - be it is the time when men and women should bury the hatchet and live in peace and harmony. Now women are vital, courageous, independent, fully equal strong but at the same it seems they do not have delicacy, sensitivity and gentleness without which our sexiness and strength, courage and independence are a hollow pose. So I do not deny femi - nists' services I just want to say that women should not forget that they are women and should nurture in themselves a kind of indomitab - le, gentle spirit that must be made more widely available, in order to, inspire a new generation of women, not by glossing over the dark rea - lities we can not afford to ignore, but by reminding us that reality is both dark and bright, and that to live with both requires courage .
