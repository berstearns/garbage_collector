Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 

In his seminal work, Animal Farm, George Orwell presents an elaborate system of allegory depicting, perhaps better than any documentary account ever could, the sinister ideology already in place in Stalin's Soviet Union, one of hipocricy and brutal repression, all in the name of progress. While filled to the brim with quotable aphorisms, one quote in particular seems to have captured the zeitgeist perfectly: [Quotation] . While this applied to the pseudocommunist system of the Soviet Union, a case can be made that it can also be applied to today's western liberal democracies, the validity of which application shall be discussed herein .
Does global capitalism today not precisely follow the logic of Orwell's pigs, creating an atmosphere of fierce and often unfair competition, where the losers are deemed lazy and unworthy, and the winners showered with praise as job creators and visionaries? Global inequallity is a topic that has only recently begun to be tackled by some of the foremost minds in both economy and philosophy, and it will take a long time before the solutions, if discovered, percolate down to the political decision makers whose job it is, at least nominally, to resolve these issues. Let me first remark upon the fact that in developed countries, such as the U.S, the vast majority of both wealth and income are hoarded by the very richest of the rich, who pay little to no taxes to the state, due to tax loopholes and offshore tax havens, thus being privileged in comparison to the middle and working class .
The extremly wealthy also wield undue political influence. Through lobbying and campaign contributions, corporations and individuals are able to bribe politicians into acting against the interests of the country and the people, and for their own (getting re-elected), and those of their benefactors. In fact, it has been ruled that corporations are effectively people, which gives them the right to free speech, and opens the floodgates of unlimited money flowing into Political Action Committees, thus tainting the political process .
On the other hand, it could well be said that we are living in a time of unparalleled social changes, a world of tolerance and social acceptance. Certain unalienable human rights have been introduced and adherence to the conventions concerning those rights are monitored across the world. The sudden and tempestuous rise of LGBT rights across the developed world is a good example of this emerging tolerance. With same-sex marriages becoming legal in the U.S. and many other countries, including Ireland, which is the first country to vote in favour of such a proposal on a referendum, LGBT rights are set to become a part of the new global order of tolerance. Women's rights have also been largely established, but there is still a rather jarring pay gap between women and men for the same amount of work. Different religious beliefs and customs are also respected in modern societies, in spite of the rise of xenophobic far-right groups across Europe and the U.S. due in large part to the migrant crisis raging through Europe .
The results of the previous considerations can be summed up as follows: equality has largely been achieved in the stratum of social equality with regard to race, sexual orientation and religion, but remain unobtainable with regard to economic considerations. So in effect, Orwell was both right and wrong, and only time will tell whether we shall one day truly live on an Animal Farm .
