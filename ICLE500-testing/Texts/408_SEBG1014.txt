Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". Agree or disagree? 

In today's society where capitalism dictates everything from the way in which we spend our time to our thoughts and feelings it is hard not to become a slave of money. We have to use it in almost every sphere of our life. Even though it can bring us innumerable benefits, it poses a great threat to our well-being and sense of self.
Our lives can be enriched by many experiences and products, such as travel, sports, makeup and more - most of which cannot possibly be attained without the help of money. Since ancient times, people have been using money for trade of their possessions. Instead of giving their goat for a bag of rice, they started using different types of coins - gold, silver or more recently, paper notes. This has enabled them to estimate the exact value of their possessions, thus allowing them to trade more fairly. With the use of money, we can also buy plane tickets and just in a few hours reach the most exotic destinations on our planet, stay in the most luxurious resorts and afford relaxing spas. Money can be often viewed as a well-deserved reward for our hard work. It often enables us to buy appliances and electronic devices which make our life easier, such as computers, mobile phones and washing machines. Having enough money offers you myrriad of choices in life and provides you with a possibility to see the world and get to know people from different cultures and walks of life.
Despite these benefits, there is however the other side of the coin - money often can and does become poisonous. We can see this notion reflected in many parts of our life. Many relationships have been ruined because the people in it could not agree on the division of money between them. Further, people from the upper class are often frowned upon when they decide to date someone from the lower social group. Girls often do not look for real values in potential partners - like honesty, courage and goodness, but instead just search for someone with a big wallet. Money brings about huge gaps within society - the differences between the elite and the poor are sharply defined and walls are not to be crossed. Worst of all, money causes terrifying wars all over the planet and provokes the worst in people - greed and selfishness. Smart children are frequently not given the access to the best education simply because they haven't been born in the rich households. There is also a saying [Quotation] - and it is true, we work more, spend time with our friends and family less just because we have a nonsencial desire to accumulate our possessions. As a result, we get more anxious, tired and bitter. Nature is being destroyed because of the human greed, air is getting more and more polluted - all of it because humans are making factories everywhere, factories that are there to help us accumulate more useless possessions. People have forgotten to love, to rejoice in simple things, to live in accordance to the nature, all because of money.
Even though it is probably impossible to banish money completely, we should all strive to find meaning in other spheres of our lives for the more noble purpuses - such as helping the poor or investing in hospitals or orphanages. In conclusion, although the statement may seem too extreme, money can sometimes indeed be "the root of all evil", as the old song has it.
