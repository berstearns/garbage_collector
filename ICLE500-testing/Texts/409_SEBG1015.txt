Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 

Society has been punishing people proven to be guilty of all possible serious and less serious crimes since the age of the first human beings who had walked this planet. As only living beings with a conscience, we have the inate ability to tell right from wrong and are taught about moral principles and what is considered "good and bad" behaviour from an early age. We've developed a legal system that enforces punishment appropriate for the committed crime and to discourage potential future criminal behaviour in order to keep people under control. The system has greatly evolved since its beginning but is it efficient enough and does it truly serve its purpose?
Many will argue in favour of the prison system not being rigorous enough due to the continuously raising rime rates all over the world. It is well known that the main rule is that "the punishment must fit the crime" but the crime victims or their closest friends and family are often dissatisfied with how the criminal is dealt with. This results in many people blaming the law and the law enforcers for being incompetent, not doing their jobs or simply the prison system being completely disfunctual. People seem to think that there would be less crime if the punishments were more severe and served as a more convincing deterrent.
While that argument might be somewhat acceptable, people seem to forget that even when a person commits a crime, no matter how serious, they are still a person. Instead of forcing criminals to pay for their crimes by simply putting them in prison, we should try a different approach such as trying to rehabilitate them. People who commit crimes are like open wounds - if we just put a bandaid over it without treating it beforehand, it will not heal properly and even if it does look healed at first glance, there'll always be a chance of it ripping open again or something even worse happening on the inside which we don't see. All people have a conscience and we should put in effort to help some of them get in touch with their's if they lost their way. Putting people away in prison is the quick and easy way of "solving" a problem, but is it the right one? If the crime rates keep going up even though we all know what awaits people who break the law, then maybe that's a sign that our methods are not efficient enough and instead of making the punishments more extreme, we should try doing the opposite - actually helping them overcome whatever issues that made them do what they did. People don't commit crimes because they are evil but because they are unhappy with themselves, their lives or have severe psychological issues possibly caused by traumatic experiences or the conditions under which they've spent their lives.
To conclude, no matter how awful the crimes committed by people are, we need to remember that it still is people who do them and therefore they should be treated as such and not just cage them like animals gone mad. This method may not always prove to be 100% succesfull, but there is no excuse for not at least trying. The goal is to heal and mend the problematic members of our society and not just isolate and punish them consequently making them feel worthless and disposable. We should want to find long term solutions to problem, not just for the time being.
