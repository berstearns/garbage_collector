Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 

The question whether equality among people exists and to what extent, has occupied minds of thoughtful individuals for milleniums. Its definition, number of layers and the way it is perceived across different cultures all add up to the complexity of this theme. Shadding the light of present day capitalism (with all of its atributs) onto the matter, we might find different peculiarities there and make a number of conclusions .
I strongly believe, and there are many evidence in support of my belief, that Orwell was right: some people are indeed more equal than others. Firstly, the most common "diferentia specifica" nowadays among people is money. The more you have it, the more protected you are, in almost all possible ways. The question "what's his/hers net worth" has become so common in the States that it is not considered unusual let alone unethical or rude to ask it on your first or second date. My country is no exception. Being a member of certain political parties in Serbia entitles you to have access to different kinds of power: jobs, opportunities, money... In addition, gender (in)equality must be given special focus. Women work just as much as men do, but they earn approximately 1/3 less. Finally, as a member of minority group, I occasionally experience national and religious bigotry and ignorance. All mentioned above led me to believe that we live in a truly inequal world .
However, things are not all that black and white, and there surely are examples of equality. Studying English at this University has thaught me that equality does exist: it doesn't really matter to professors who you are, what do you wear and what is your social status, but rather you performance and knowledge. Furthermore, people are equal in pain, love, hate, grief... You can't possibly avoid any of them no matter what. The ultimate equality marker we also can't possibly avoid is death. In the words of famous Serbian poet Jovan Ducic, [Quotation] . 
To sum up, even though there are things that can lead us into believing that people are equal, it is imensely important to be able to tell the difference between equality in abstract things (we are all capable of by nature), and equality in real life terms. Infortunately, due to many causes, most of which are of economical and political nature, equality in real life will remain to be just another utopistic idea that individuals will spend time debating on .
