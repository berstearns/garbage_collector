Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

The term feminism firs appeared in the 20th century and was associated with groups of women who organized protests and rallies to fight for women's rights. The most famous group was the Suffragette movement which was notorious for being the most radical of them all. This was considered the first wave of feminism by many historians and sociologists. They brought the traditional patriarchal system to its knees and said: "We will not be treated like cattle, we are human beings like everyone else, and we deserve equal rights." Although I must agree that first wave feminism created a better world for women and gender relations in general, I believe without a doubt that third wave feminism, or modern day feminism, seeks to damage these relationships that the first wave so desperately sought to create and in a way, unconsciously maybe, tries to destroy it .
On one hand, feminism should provide a safe haven for weak individuals, some modern feminists include men as well, and give them strength and ambition in life. Feminists today are seen as strong excentric individuals, male and female, who fight for equality because they believe that this goal is still not achieved. With the help of social media third wave feminists have gathered many followers all across the world and are supported by many different social justice groups which help them in battling their issues. There are numerous social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube where they share videos in which they spread their messages of equality and justice. There are numerous TV channels that broadcast talk shows where top feminists are invited to talk about social issues. The Internet is the true battlefield for feminists and social justice warriors, who fight against inequality and the horrible patriarchy .
On the other hand, I believe that this movement only consists of groups of attention seekers who are trying to become famous for doing something for the society and gender relations when in fact all they talk about are already resolved issues. Their most frequently used argument is the gender pay gap. They argue that every woman earns 74 cents for every man's dollar, but they fail to reallise that this issue has already been resolved a long time ago and that women actually earn more than a man does. The second argument is the white male privilege argument. They claim that white men are being treated than white women, or women of different colour, by having more rights and being offered better job positions. The thing one, and probably the one most feminists and social justice warriors use in everyday communication is the "man constantly rape" argument. This argument creates the biggest problem for gender relations as it is, as mentioned before, forced through the media and social networks by highly respected feminist celebrities worldwide. The problem is that they claim that every form of sexual harassment, be that verbal or physical, or any kind of misconduct towards women should be considered rape and should be legally punished. Unfortunatelly, this lead to cases where women sued men under the claim that the fact they had too much to drink on the night when they had intercourse is sufficient enough of an excuse to prove that they did not give consent. Feminists even agree that this should apply to married couples as well .
In conclusion, it is my honest opinion that third wave feminism creates, or happens to create unconsciously, a world where gender relations are broken, unsafe, unsecure, and without trust which is crucial for healthy relationships by promoting a form of propaganda throug liberal media and social networks .
