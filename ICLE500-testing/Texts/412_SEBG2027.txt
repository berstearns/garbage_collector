Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 

The Middle East crisis, terrorism threats, immigrant crisis, economies which are standing on a slippery slope, it seems as though the worldwide turmoil has no intention of settling down. And just as the world is suffocating in problems, the humanity stands its greatest test, are we looking past the skin color, religious belief, genders and all other categorizations, or are we still guided by the common human vanity and egoism?
Trouble and misery have always brought people together, as the old saying goes [Quotation] . And it might sound harsh, but there is something beautiful in seeing people come together, united, just for one cause - to help one another. The sense of equality which floods the masses gathered around the ones in trouble may be one of the requisites of the 21st century. We have all witnessed it. Last year we were all Charlie, Je suis Charlie, couple of years before that the world had turned all of its compassion to Japan, watching in dread the catastrophic events following the earthquake. And what about the crisis in Middle East and the rivers of people escaping the war, gushing at the borders of Europe. At first all of the border countries welcomed the immigrants, sensibly right?! [Quotation] these were some of the comments heard in every day's chatter... For a second it looked as the world had got a message, and that there were no stopping for the spirit of unity, equality, humanity and all thee unfaithful to the goodness in people would be converted.
But then, the rivers of people wouldn't stop gushing, and the world became afraid. The borders started to close for some of the refugees. It soon became clear that the selectiveness of the "gate keepers" was instructed from the high above, the politics and economy (read - money) had the key to better life. The humanity soon abolished their hope in equality which has become obsolete. The fear conjoined with the vanity of the people and the prejudices took place to common sense. Instead of uniting, the world is dividing, it seem that now more than ever the categories are visible, nationalities, skin color, religious beliefs, careers we are in, the money we earn. The xenophobic societies finally have finally arose as something acceptable. More than ever George Orwell is right: [Quotation] . We have put a value to human life. Simply it is not the same if a white European (or for that matter - American) person dies, or the Middle Eastern person's life is in question.
Even though one might argue that the dreams of equality are possible, and that we have achieved a lot in that area, still it is inevitable to notice all the inequality and selective practice of the basic human rights nowadays. There is no value to human life, we are all the same, the same food feeds us and the same diseases kill us. Who is to say that one is better than the other? Well, I'd like to say no one, but you and I know this is not true.
