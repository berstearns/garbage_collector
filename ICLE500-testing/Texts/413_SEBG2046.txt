Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

Nowadays, most of us can't imagine their lives without technology. We have been using it on daily basis, for work, education, communication etc. It helped us and made our lives easier in many ways, but it also has its disadvantages .
Science, technology and industrialization improved our lives in number of ways in many different areas. I believe that if we use it right, not only that it doesn't limit our imagination, but it can actually inspire us to dream bigger, broad our views, make us think and become more creative and imaginative. First of all, most of us have computers and internet at our homes. Thanks to these, we have access to the latest news, so we can stay informed; to social networks, so we can stay in touch with people or even meet new friends online; to many e-books and audio which we might not find in the bookstores in our country, to many online courses of languages, science, etc. which we can attend for free, in case we can't afford them. Therefore, technology can be incredibly useful. We can discover new things every day, stimulate our gray cells and thus become more creative, innovative and come up with amazing ideas. Second, we can say thanks to science for being able to cure many deseases which used to be considered deadly a few centuries ago; for explaining what is going on in the world around us (quantum physics, space exploration...) all of this inspires us to learn more, maybe discover our hidden talents, dream about things we thought were impossible. It can inspire us to do great things, maybe write a fantasy novel, become an astronaut or define new laws of physics. Third, when industrialization began, it was developing rapidly, because every invention and a machine inspired people to create more of them and make their lives easier. Every scientist, inventor or engineer must be a dreamer and have creative spirit. They all dream of making this world a better place for every human being .
On the other hand, science, technology and industrialization have their disadvantages too. First, some people might use scientific breakthroughs for their own hidden agendas. Not everyone wants to do good. They might use science to harm people, destroy nature or fulfill their childhood dream of rulling the world. Second, people might start relying on technology too much. They can become lazy and refuse to use their brains, their imagination. They just do not want to be bothered, because for some reason, they believe they already have everything they need and that they know everything they need to know. They have no desire to explore further and discover new things. Also, when it comes to industrialization, people think that machines we already have are good enough, that there is apsolutely no need for improvement or adjustments. Therefore, we can see that, in a way, technology can be dreadful for our dreams and imagination, it can stop us from striving for better, because we think we already have everything and that there are no mysteries left to be discovered .
To conclude, if we know how to use technology for self improvement and development, if we want to use science to make this world a better place and do good and if we are able to use the advancement of industrialisation to make our lives easier this can only benefit us and our brains. It can motivate us, educate us, make us become better people, strive for better and dream bigger .
