Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". Agree or disagree? 

We live in a world where everything seems to be revolving around money and making money. Industries and businesses are flourishing at an unprecedented rate, and we seem to be losing ourselves in this vicious circle of making more and more profit. Our society has become industrialised and materialistic to an extent that has never been seen before, people are judged or appreciated depending on how rich they are. Although money is necessary for most essential things in life, I strongly believe that it is money that in fact is the root of all evil, or at least, the root of most of it .
Money makes the world go round they say, and this is a fact well known nowadays. It is essential for everyday life, we need it for clothes, food, hygene, to begin with the small things, but also rent, bills, gas, and similar expenses. But money has much more power than to just be used for mere expenses of our daily life. Money is the fuel which makes numerous great things possible, such as all sorts of cures for illnesses, materials for technological equipment, medical equipment, different research projects and experiments which may change the world in the future. And although they say that you can't buy the most important things in life such as love, happiness or health, the sad truth is that if you are well-positioned in society you will have more friends, be able to afford more things and also be more likely to be healthy since you will have the option to choose healthier options in your alimentation, because we all know how pricey eating healthy can be. And, bottom line, if you happen to get ill, you need money for medication or in the worst case a surgery, so if you wanted you would be able to choose a better medical institution to go to than the state hospital .
However, in spite of all the perks of money, I strongly believe that it is the money and wealth that are the causes of world's biggest evils. Starting with ignorance, far from me saying that wealthy people are ignorant, but some of them set a very bad example for their children by giving them too much freedom and no responsibilities. This we can see in various examples, such as the "Rich Kids of Tehran" profile on Instagram which first came to my mind. They show off their wealth, their collections of gold watches, the piles of dollar bills, the luxurious cars and mansions, but what they don't show off is class, modesty or knowledge. They grow up to be pompous daddy-sons and daughters and few of them become scientists, explorers, writers, or contribute in any way to their society, and that is just the ignorance which money causes. It causes far worse things, and one of them is pollution. Our environment is getting more and more polluted and industry is becoming more and more developed nevertheless. The ozone layer is ruined, the climate is changing and all most people care about is not losing money. The air and water are severely polluted, but all we see is more cars and more ships. Where this will lead our future generations, we are yet to see. But the worst thing that money causes is war. Were it not for money, would there be nuclear weapons, or any other kind of weapons with the power to destroy the entire planet? Hardly. Greed in itself is not sufficient anymore, you need money to make anything possible, especially war. The saddest thing is that human lives have become to be valued through money and if a soldier dies in war, his family will receive a certain amount of money for their loss .
We live in a modern age where everything and anything is possible, and it is possible thanks to money. We see all the grand shiny things money has made possible, but few of us will actually think of what we've lost because of money. And we've lost a lot. Should we continue following this path, soon enough we will lose ourselves .
