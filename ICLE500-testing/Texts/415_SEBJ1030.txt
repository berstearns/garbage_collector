Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 

In the 21st century, we are facing extreme materialism and it is obvious that most people only care about power and money. Every day, we witness many cases of workers being abused and made to work more than they are paid for. This, as well as other occurrences lead us to the conclusion already given in the title "All men are equal: but some are more equal than others."
A good example to illustrate this statement could be politics nowadays. Wealthy countries dominate the poor ones; even though slavery and colonialism are far behind, we still see that oppression is happening in a subtle way. For example, Africa's natural recources are widely exploited by more powerful countries; sometimes even wars emerge whose true cause are those resoruces - but this is only one thing people do in order to gain more money. We hear statements promoting equality of all people every day, but those are only words; in real life, the situation is quite the opposite. Also, the taxes people pay to their countries should be collected for public expenses, but many politicians neglect citizens' welfare and secretly spend the money for their own needs.
Children and teenagers also face different situations proving that not all people are equal. In schools, the only important thing for pupils has become to look good, have expensive clothes, smartphones and even expensive cars in some cases. The worst thing about that is that a great many parents encourage this in a way and spend a lot of money on their children. It is surprising that even some teachers prefer rich pupils to those who are not equally wealthy. Those who can't afford expensive things are rejected and looked upon as people who don't deserve the same treatment like others. They often have to try much harder, and even in that case success is not guaranteed.
More importantly, in a society where capitalism dominates, workers don't have the rights they should have - they are not paid enough, they perform many jobs simultaneously and they often work longer than they should. An employee in a coffee shop often has to serve thy guests, clean and do any other work necessary. This is another way for more powerful people to make fortune by using others' abilities and hard work. The law is also corrupted and it doesn't protect those people who are forced to work in those harsh conditions in order to make a living. Not only do they have to work hard, but they are not treated equally when they try to get a job - we often hear that somebody had paid a specific sum of money or that they are employer's cousins and were employed owing to these facts.
However, in the last few decades there have been considerable changes concerning women and ethnic minorities, for example. In the past centuries, women had barely any rights; they were not allowed to vote during elections and were not paid as highly as men. That is all in the past now and the situation concerning the equality of sexes is getting better. Also, some ethnic groups were discriminated by the society until recently, but now this is changed and these people can claim their rights as well. Also, some political associations such as the United Nations help to promote human rights and assistance between countries.
Many organizations have been founded recently whose goal is to help poor people and there are always new campaigns promoting human rights and equality of all people. Many people are willing to help and they often donate money and other necessary things useful for those who need help, not taking their race or nationality into consideration. For example, the Red Cross is an international organization whose aim is the benefit of old, sick and poor people from around the world.
To sum up, equality is certainly promoted in the society, but it is controversial and also raises questions about how true this is in real life. Even through media, we are faced with numerous prejudices and attitudes that show us that some men truly are more equal than others. Unfortunately, all these prejudices are mostly based on money as an indication of how valuable people are.
