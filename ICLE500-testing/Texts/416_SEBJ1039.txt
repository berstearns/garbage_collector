Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 

Equality. That is what we all talk about every day and what people have been fighting for for ages, but, when we take everything into account - do we really see and respect all people equally?
There is no doubt that, overall, the question of equality has raised to a much higher level. However, statements, comments etc. we get to hear from some people make us think that there are still problems regarding that, and that there always will be. How can someone, e.g. say they support this and that activity, person, but then, when for a certain group, a religion or nationality, that same person says negative things about people belonging to those groups, based on some things s/he heard before about them. I would know what this feels like, since coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina, that is most likely always going to be labeled as "the war country where everyone is still killing everyone", makes me come across people who write the worst things about my country and nationality online, calling all of us "criminals, killers, maniacs" etc. Is that the equality some are asking for?
Speaking of the world in general, I can't help but feel that, in a way, people rate one's life more than another's. People seem to choose whose life is important, and whose is not. I was raised that way to see every life equally, every innocent life lost as a tragedy, no matter where that innocent life came from, what color it was, what religion... This might be a bit egoistic, but, how don't all people have this view on one's life like me, since they're already raising their voice for equality?
The recent Paris attacks that were a huge tragedy and brought sadness to everyone, are an example how this world chooses who to care about and pay attention to. That same day, there were attacks, big murders and disasters in a few different countries on other continents. How many people posted something about those tragedies on their social media? Barely anyone, or a really small number, compared to the ones focusing on Paris attacks only. Of course, there is never a BUT for the innocent human victims, because every life matters the same, or at least that should be the case. But, there is a BUT for people who choose to cry over one specific group but totally ignore the others, since they are "irrelevant" in their eyes. Why is it so?
We can blame it on the media. Sure, media divide people into important/not important groups and so they present stories following that order. It is already known that people mostly believe in those things that are "served" to them, without thinking twice or trying to find out more. So, if the media only talk about one tragedy or attack - people will only care about that. However, we use the Internet every day, how can't we notice that there are other people who suffer and die every day? I might be rude, but, it seems like we don't care. People care about the "big" countries and cities and nations, yet others who they are not familiar with are completely ignored and their tragedies are barely even mentioned anywhere. Where's that famous "equality" in all of that? How can one call himself "a fighter for equality" if he/she still labels people based on their differences, no matter what they are? If one sees an entire group of people through some bad individuals, what exactly is that equality they're fighting for?
When some people hear where you're coming from, they make a picture of you and your country and it's usually going to be a stereotyped one, so if you are, like me, from a "notorious" country, the first images people will get of you won't be the brightest. Trust me, I've faced this.
The quote by George Orwell, [Quotation] is still accurate and, unfortunately, will be for a long time. I wish I was wrong, but there's nothing telling me that this will change. Since I can't always think about what other people think, I will focus on myself and be happy to say I'm not one of the people who treat others differently based on who they are and where they come from.
