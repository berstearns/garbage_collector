Title: Is capital punishment defensible?

Capital punishment is a form of punishment where the perpetrator is sentenced to death. Throughout the history many execution methods were used, such as beheading, hanging, guillotine, crucifixion, gas chamber, firing squad, etc. During the middle ages different techniques of torture usually preceded the death penalty. Today mostly lethal injection and electrocution are used as execution methods in the USA. Some other countries that retained the death penalty are People's Republic of China, North Korea, Japan, Somalia and most states in the Middle East. Whether this is a justified decision remains a debatable issue .
It could be argued that death penalty is defensible. Committing offences such as murder or rape demands justice to be served. Many people believe that such offences should be punishable by death. They claim that capital punishment can set an example for other criminals and help the crime rates decrease, as crime in their countries is increasing. I would disagree on this and state that there are no statistics that prove that capital punishment helps when it comes to countering crime. If a person decides to commit an offence, he or she will do that regardless of circumstances, so the statement that capital punishment will frighten possible perpetrators is not reliable .
Furthermore, opponents are sure that it is cheaper to execute a person than to make them serve a sentence without parole. This argument is invalid since there was a study done in California which discovered that it was more expensive to execute a person than to keep them in prison for life .
In support of death penalty some may say that legal system is fair. However, there is a racial bias in the USA where most countries which used to belong to The Confederacy perform executions. Majority of those who are put on death row are African Americans. Additionally, most of those who are put on death row are poor and cannot afford a good defense attorney .
 [Quotation] . This is the lesson of nonviolence which leader of Indian independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, tried to teach us. By killing someone we display exactly the same behavior, proving that we are not better than those who committed crimes. This means that by killing those who kill we became killers as well .
Death penalty eliminates all possibility for rehabilitation. If we murder murderers, we are not solving the problem of high rate of serial killers, but vaguely disguising that problem is being solved. If we want to abolish death penalty, we have to offer some form of alternative. One form of replacement may be prison sentence without parole, but one could refute this by saying that this is no solution since prisons are already crowded. The proper solution would be rehabilitation of perpetrators in the form of expert help from psychologists and psychiatrists. In addition, help of religious kind can be useful for some of the convicts. There are many examples where religion helped people change for better. To conclude with, death penalty does not represent a solution to problems but only an easier way out. We must consider more humane and moral ways of dealing with crimes against humanity .
