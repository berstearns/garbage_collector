Title: Is capital punishment defensible?

There are many moral, practical, and economic reasons to oppose the death penalty. To introduce the law which allows someone's life to be taken is not an easy decision to make and many sides have to be examined before making final decision. It is not just the question of the money, or of racial issues, or complex moral dillemas, but all of this these combined, and many more. What does many more exactly mean? Let's find out .
Moral arguments which oppose death penalty that have to be considered are various. Besides the obvious, but complex dilemma as to whether anybody claims the right to kill somebody, no matter what the accused did, there are many other problems to face. First of all, one has to ask himself, "would bringing this law be direct assault on the free will, which is the basis of the modern society?" Any kind of radical restriction of human behaviour could produce a devastating effect, and shake the already loose foundations of the existing world. Furthermore, many, if not all religions profess non-violence, and we must admit that our society is still not completely secularized. Hence, new issues on that front would appear. Lastly, but not least, it has been shown throughout the history that revenge and retaliation were almost never a good solution. Indeed, moral aspects seem as too much too swallow in order for capital punishment to be introduced .
On the another side of this problem lie practical reasons that oppose the introduction of the death penalty. Many studies have been published, but still there are not many, or any viable ones, that confirm the effectiveness of the capital punishment. There is no confirmed data that any of more than 30 countries around the world that practice this type of sanction, including PR China and the USA, have smaller crime rates than the countries which abolished it. Moreover, countries with distinct racial and economic differences, have a hard time providing equal defense for each of their residents, hence many poor people and members of minorities (or both) are more prone to be condemned than the rich, who are often protected by their wealth, and by the country itself. It is not hard to see that anyone defending the death penalty would have to tackle great practical obstacles .
Finally, there is an economic aspect of this problem. Death penalty takes much of the taxpayers' money. It come as a surprise, but it is a truth that it costs less to incarcerate offenders and feed and clothe them, then to send them on a death row. Most of the world economies are already struggling, so any new expense is not welcome. Thus we can say with certainty that death penalty is not economically viable .
To sum up, death penalty brings more harm than good. Morally, economically and practically, consequences of its introduction are vast and it looks as another way has to be found to treat dangereous criminals. This one just affect us too much, both in our minds and our wallets .
