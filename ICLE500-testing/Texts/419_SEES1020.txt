Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". Agree or disagree? 

An old song of the Andrews Sisters "Money is the root of all evil" gives us a few reasons why this is incontestable true. Of course there are many more reasons unrelated to song but this time I will single out just few of them from the song in order to show you why I agree with this words. So, in the song we can find that money gives us just a temporarily satisfaction, deprives us from emotions and true values in the life, and finally it contaminates us with higher desire for it. Let me give you more details .
So as I mentioned this song tells us that money gives us a just temporarily satisfaction and I completely agree with it. We all know that money's duration is not long. There are many cases where somebody won the lottery or got the money in some other way, and soon thereafter spend all that money. There is no proper way to save that money if you are not satisfied with things that you already have. Therefore this bring us to another reason why money is the root of all evil .
The second reason that shows us all the evil of the money is closely conectected to previous one. Better said, while the money gives us a just temporarily satisfaction it deprives us from emotions and true values in the same time. The best explanation is given in the words of song: [Quotation] . So it shows us which are true values that we need to respect and also shows us that these values you can not buy. You can possess all the luxury but if you don't have inner satisfaction all that luxury is not important. But the most difficult is the way to cognition. Lot of people spend a big part of their lives in attempts to get more money and in last years of their lives they realize that all the effort was wasted. So all these attempts to get more money represent one more reason why the money is the root of all evil .
In the words [Quotation] is shown how the money contaminates us with higher desire for it. We all start with small desires but as we fulfill them our desires become higher. In this way our desire for money constantly increasing. And again it is connected to previous reasons why the money is the root of all evil. With our desires for money we forget true values. So everything this represent a vicious circle in which we are loosing ourselves just for higher desires .
So to sum up, all these reasons that are given in the old song of the Adrews Sisters "Money is the root of all evil" and about which I said before, give us a true image of money. I've wrote how I experienced this song and lessons that I've learnt from it. I hope you agree with me at least in some statements .
