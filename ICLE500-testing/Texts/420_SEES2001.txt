Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

As the world's developing grows incredibly fast, we are not even aware of all of the changes that is bringing to us. Science achievements, technology inventions and huge industrialization, each of them affects on each of us. It is clear - there are consequences, but they are expectable and reasonable consequences and results are both good and bad and their influences are more or less equal. However, we should finally distinct them and provide all of the good and bad sides of this modern age. Are we completely overtaken by modern achievements? Are we robots, machines, emotionless and programmed or they still haven't got such a hold on us? If they have, how to deal with it and what to do?
Has the science reached its own top? Look around. Science is everything and everywhere. Technology is everything and everywhere. Industrialization too. We are surrounded by mobile phones, computers, all of the kinds of machines. Those machines are working and living with us and for us. I can not imagine spending only one day without my phone. On the first place, because of communication, on the second place, because of the information - some things for school and education and for my personal interests. And that's brilliant! Being able to talk with a friend who's miles away. Being able to see a friend, to share photos etc. Furthermore, whenever we need to know something, which we knew but forgot or we simple want to know, we can just ask "Google". "Google" knows. We are completely informed, completely protected and we have completely solved our lack of knowledge. Or we at least think we have.
The internet opens a whole new life and a whole new world to us. There is no single thing that we can not find on the internet. Internet's options and knowledges are endless. In this connotation, we can not see bad sides of technology. Various kind of social media, "Facebook", "Youtube", "Instagram", people, (mainly young people) find very useful, productive and interesting. Some of them are quite inspirational, which gives the ideas for people to think more, to create more, to search more, to develop more. We have a numerous examples everywhere, of people who started working on internet. At the beggining, it started as a hoby, now, they have already earned a bunch of money.
Every day we are exposed to the influences of social media. We are living our lives there. Fortunatelly, not all of us but there's already a quite big number of those who are affected. People are not aware that the things we see out there, they are all fake. Most of the time. Following celebrity profiles, seeing the kind of life that they're living, seeing the way they look alike and as the result - wanting to be them, wanting to be like them. Although it's impossible, and completely ridiculous, young people are giving their best to make the exact copy of life their idol has. Young girls are constantly on diets, constantly under make-up and constantly taking photos of themselves - all in order to get more "likes", more "followers" and to make people like them. It's insane. Number of young girls doing this is already huge and they are giving all and living for "likes".
Is there still a room for dreaming, imagination and creation? Sure there is! Those who were born to dream and to create, they'll always find a way to make a wonderful things and to say them. There will never be such technology or industrialization that is going to kill people's tendency for dreaming. What's more, they'll always be making new invents. Those who dream are those who brought and who are still bringing the greatest achievements in all fields of science, technology and industry.
