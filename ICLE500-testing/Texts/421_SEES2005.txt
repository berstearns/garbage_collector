Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

The media is everywhere and takes up a great deal of people's everyday lives. Nowadays, technology is advenced that much, that sometimes is impossible to imagine life without it. People depend on the media to provide them with the information that otherwise would be hard to get. My opinion is that technology, science and industrialization can have positive and negative effects on society. We can take Mass Media as an example .
First of all, I want to mention that media affects society in many different ways, such as: businesses use media to promote their products, the media effects communication and the media affects body image and behaviour of people in society. When we talk about business, we can say that companies use the media to convince consumers to buy their products. Since the start of Mass Media, companies have used communication to broadcoast to large numbers of people about their product. Companies use online advertisement to influence people to buy their products. Also, a lot of people are influenced to buy a product because of post on social media websites by their friends. So, that is how the media spreading new products and attracts consumers to buy it .
The people of society, use the media to communicate with friends, family and people all around the world. In modern world we can not imagine life without technology. In the past 50 years, the media has grown its influence significantly with the changes in new technology, starting with the telegraph all the way to today's internet. Due to the rapid spread of media to all parts of the world, the access to information is easy and fast. Owing to web technology almost everyone has access to information from anywhere in the world .
On the contrary, there is also negative influence of media. When we say there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination, that is true. Nowadays, people are so dependent on social media they are becoming more and more disconected with the world around them. They are always on their phones or other form of communication device, causing people to become disconnected with what is happening around them and not to live in the moment. Our ideas are changed with the influence of media. We are neglecting much important things such as knowledge, education, friendship... Because the influence of media on teenagers, kids, society is huge they need to be informed on how the media actually works .
We also can not have our own opinion, dreams and illusions if we are only leaning on the media. We are determined that we are going to find everything we search for on the Internet and than there is no need to have your own imagination. Also, media influences the way people look at themselves and how they behave. It is no secret that advertisers use photoshop to edit photos to make the person in it look more appealing. It can take years or even longer people to come to the realization that the images they see are manipulated. Living in society where most of the images people see may not be real is damaging .
In conclusion, the media and technology in general affects society in many different ways. People use the media in their everyday lives to communicate with each other, and to know what is happening in the world. The media can have negative influence too, on the way people view themselves and how people behave. So we can say that in modern world the media has both positive and negative influence on society .
