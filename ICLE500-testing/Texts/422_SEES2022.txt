Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 

The world is full of criminals and their work never stops so we are in constant struggle in making decisions how to deal with them. One thing is sure, current prison system is heavily outdated with some basics that should be kept. Constant deaths in the prisons, people being tortured and raped all over the world just prove this theory and the another theory that not every criminal can be rehabilitated. Also, not everyone deserves a second chance too .
The biggest crimes that the man can imagine can not be justified thus the criminals don't deserve a chance to be rehabilitated. Mass murderers, terrorists, people who steal from the poor, drug lords and many more can not be rehabilitated simply because they don't deserve it. They have done to much harm to be treated with respect and simpathy and they deserve to root firstly in prison and in the hell afterwards. Constant beating, deaths and torturing suits them perfectly but it is important to say that not everyone deserves the same .
People make mistakes. That is the fact. Someone, steals in order to feed the family, someone kills in self-defence and there is a whole bunch of young people outside, watching "Godfather" trilogy and in order to be "cool", do some crazy stuff. That people need someone and to teach them what is good and what is bad. Personal note: even me and my friends were on the trial when we were young, for robbing one house we were thinking it was empty. We got our lesson and since that time, we were never ever in contact with any criminal or even thinking of doing one ourselves .
Money. So important thing but for some reason when it comes to the prison system issue, people tend to forget to mention it. Paying for the clothes, paying the guards, the staff of the prison, food and many other things, costs every country a fortune. Do not forget about the special prisons with television, internet, and a lot of things that average citzen can not achieve. We could instead force the prisoners to work for the country. Let them work on the fields, clean the streets and by doing that, make some money for the country. Let them repay what they stole, if they did, or let them try to wash their sins by helping the society. Do everything to make them better people for the good of the community where they live. There are some rumours that Americans did some experiments to their prisoners but that is too brutal and not a good example, not much money in it .
Rehabilitation is often just an exuse by the prisoners or their lawyers in order to make their clients look better in the eyes of the judge, and a free ticket out of the jail. It is silly to talk that someone can change after a few years in prison by being surrounded with heavy criminals. It is absurd, speaking of which, we need specialized facilities for rehabilitation and a huge number of people willing to help the criminals. The people in charge have to be sharp-minded because it is nothing for one murderer to try to lie that he is "cured", because some believe in theories that some people are born for criminals and they will try to decieve so we need to be careful. On the other hand, a lot of prisoners became a well-known and respected citzens and we should strive for it .
In order to change the prison system, we need to change the laws too. Legalize the weed, make some verdicts that sent you the prison to be payable instead because to pay hurts the most for certain people. This shouldn't be taken lightly and we the best people specialized in law to work on this. Make the prison days productive and meaningful but lower the durations of the verdicts lower, but make them remember every single day spent in prison .
Fear is the biggest reason why people will try to be good. Use propaganda in a good way, educate children, reward good examples and there won't be criminals in the first place, so no one to rehabilitate or only a few stubborn people. Prison system must be changed as soon as possible with the help of every citizen of the country, for the greater good, for the generation that is coming. We have experience and solid ground, let us show that the human is the most inteligent being on the planet. After the dolphins .
