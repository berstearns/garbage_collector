Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". Agree or disagree? 

One could hardly ever imagine the world we know without the green blood that runs through the veins of what we know as economy and at the same time, it acts as fuel for the engines of industry and ever-changing technology, and that of course is money. The statement that money is the root of all evil, when looked at logically, is only true to a certain degree. Instead, I would argue that money is purely a tool, it shapes people and exposes their hidden desires, wishes and character traits by either corrupting them as it is most often the case, or for those people that are truly inherently good, it liberates them and allows them to help those who truly need it .
Firstly, it would be wrong and utterly foolish to blame the evil of this world on money, even before money, there was the lust for power in men and that is what causes the corruption. Corruption and political affairs are the primary means through which the consequences of this power-lust are reflected on average people and their everyday lives. One could go on for days counting the instances where individuals sold their ideals, beliefs and took up a cause for the side that was harmful to few our people, and this is especially evident in the Balkans and felt up to this day. There are consequences for everything we do, however, those that are to blame would never admit their guilt and it is our own fault as a collective of all human beings for the attrocious conditions of our lives. It is tremendously easy for those in power to control the people when people are so weak-minded .
However, no matter how degenerate and desperate the times we live in seem to be, there will always be a handful of people that well remain pure and untouched by powerlust. Examples are people like Mother Tereza, when she received the Nobel prize for her work and a million dollars that go with it, she gave all the money to the cause of buying food for the starving people, a million dollars worth of rice and had a second of doubt about it .
Finally, even with all this said, there remains a grim picture of what awaits us in the future. Humans have reached a treshold and become stuck in a nut, and there is only the path of downfall if we don't change our consciousness from the core because whether there be money or not, the problem lies in all of us .
