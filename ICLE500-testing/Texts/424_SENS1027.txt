Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". Agree or disagree? 

Money is the most ridiculous thing that has ever been invented since the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Money is one of two main reasons why we are going through such struggle these days. The second reason is people's enormous thirst for power. However, these two are closely related. I went to the secondary school of economics and I still remember when we learned how money was invented in Italy somewhere around 13th century, I believe. What I remember best is that the invention of money imediately triggered some conflicts among people. It does not matter which form money takes, the consequences are the same. However, people often have to accept things as they are. In other words, we have to get up at 6 AM each morning, work all day long until a woman from a political party calls us and asks us to vote and to join one of those political satanistic organizations. If there were no money, there would be no politics and our life would be perfect. If people weren't greedy and shared food and properties, there wouldn't be a need for something like the money is. Money is just a physical form of human greed, which is one of seven deadly sins. Every time I try to read news, I end up with reading either about some wars somewhere in the world or about amazingly bad political situation in my country. Everything is the consequence of human greed, gluttony, lust, and many more "virtues" that will lead this world to an end. Therefore, if someone asked me how to try to define money, I would say that it was a piece of Satan's hand. Every single war after WW2 started by offering enormous sums of money to some people that were "chosen" to do their job. But I must admit that it works perfectly. Now they legalize weed only to earn some profit, even on their own kids. It has gone too far, in my opinion. I should be politically correct and say that the money can be good, too. No, it is awesome, because you can buy sausages, gallows, or even duckling. It is true, but they are using it to buy armor and guns, to build their new airplanes and to support the world's progressive degradation and destruction. It doesn't matter who is who - all people are the same - they tend to destroy everything. The most evil consequence of the use of money is the change in personality of a certain person. Money changes people and they are never again the same. What they want is always more, and more, and more. This leads us to conclusion that those people are not so happy as it may seem. It is very interesting that many rich and successful artists died of some very expensive drugs and later it was discovered that they were depressive for some reason. That reason can easily be the money. The more you have - the more you want. People forget why they wake up and they lost their purpose in life beside that much euros and dollars. However, I still believe that things can change. The money was not dirty and bloody until people made it be like that. The only reason why I like money is the word money, because if money had not been invented, Pink Floyd wouldn't have been able to make one of their best guitar solos of all time besides "Comfortably Numb". Everything other about money is bad because bad people use it for bad purposes. The others use it to buy bread, which is fine.
