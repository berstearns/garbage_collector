Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". Agree or disagree? 

The saying that [Quotation] has probably never been more true than it is in our time. Money is a crucial aspect of everyone's lives and it can be said that it controles our lives. After all, we need money to provide the basic things we need in order to survive: food, water, shelter, as well as all the other things we need in everyday life. Money is also probably the main reason people have jobs; in order to have money we have to earn it by doing something which can be valued. Being such an important part of our lives, it is no wonder people think that "Money is the root of all evil" and I tend to agree with these words and will explain in this essay why .
One of the first things which come to mind when thinking about how money is the root of our problems is the different ways people get it. Having the importance that it has in our lives, it is easy to understand why some people would do almost anything to gain certain amounts of it. Not everyone is ready to work the same way as most people do, to have a job which benefits the community in some way, but choose to do things which are in our society considered as illegal or unethical. Those things can range from petty crimes to serious offences which can harm someone's life, but what they all have in common is that they harm our community and the rules we chose to live by, all because of money .
Another claim for money being the cause of all bad things in this world is our dependence on it. Money is so integrated in our way of living that today nobody can function without it. People need money in order to have drinking water and food, healthcare and homes, not to mention all the other things needed for a person to be a part of the society. To have a normal life, one needs money, which is why we are all as a society obsessed with having it .
One another reason for seeing "money as root of all evil" is the status and importance we have become accustomed in ascribing to it. Money today has a god-like importance to people. Their value is often measured with the amount of money they have or do not have. Many people see it as a solution to all of lives problems and the lack of it as the end of the world. Money is often the reason of numerous family fall-outs, ended friendships and relationships. This status and importance we give to money leads many people to value it more than the things which in truth are much more important than bank notes .
All in all, there are many reasons why money can be seen as the root of all bad things in the world, including the ways some people get it, our dependence on it and the status and importance we give it. Greed for money only brings out the worst in people which shows that, truly "Money is the root of all evil".
