Title: In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil". Agree or disagree? 

Does money cause all our problems? It is a very frequently asked question these days, with a plethora of different answers and opinions. Some claim that with money everything is easier; some claim that a piece of paper cannot make your life better. But, one cannot deny, the whole world spins around money.
There are actually two different worlds - the rich one and the poor one. In the world full of money, expensive cars, luxurious mansions, glamour and glitter everything seems to be perfect. Looked from the outside, it really does seem perfect. However, there is much deeper and darker side hidden beneath all that shine. If you look closer into lives of, for example, famous persons, it is not happiness that you see. No. It is dissatisfaction, anger, helplessness. One cannot resist asking "Why? Why, when they have everything they want?" Now comes the question of what is really the thing humans want. Cars? Clothes? Expensive hotels? Overloaded bank accounts? People who have all these things do not actually care about them. They are slaves to their fortune. What is the purpose of a huge house if you live there alone? What is the purpose of millions and billions if you have no one to spend them with?
Next are a little less rich people, those who own companies or have well paid jobs so they can afford themselves a luxurious life. Those are people who are never at home, who pay a babysitter to raise their children because they are too busy with earning money. Those are lonely men and women who left their beloved ones or were left by them because they missed every birthday and anniversary, because they were working late. No matter how much money you have, you can never buy time. The true values do not lie in money and in things you can buy with money. Only those who have it know that.
On the other hand, there are people who have so little, almost nothing, speaking materialistically, but actually they have everything. How comes? Well, maybe a mother cannot afford to buy her children the latest phone, but she can spend some time playing with them, she waits them with hot lunch on the table, she is there to kiss them goodnight. Maybe a boyfriend doesn't have money for expensive dinner, but he will make one by himself. Maybe a father cannot buy his son a new car, but he will come to every football mach his son plays. That is the true luxury. It is shame that so many people never realize that, or when they do, it is too late.
Money is an addiction, a sickness. No matter how much you have it, it is never enough, you always want more and more. But it is not money to be blamed. After all, it is nothing more than a piece of paper. The true evil lies in people themselves. Human's greed and envy are the biggest evil force in the world. Money is not alive, it cannot consciously cause you troubles and bring you misery. It is simply a means to an end, and you are the one who decides what that end will be. The best things in life come for free, it has always been like that, and it will always be.
