Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
The statement "feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good" is false. In fact, feminists are the ones who have fought and managed an improvement of women's situation in society, although there is still a hard work to do. In order to support this argument, we are going to review the following subjects: Labour discrimination, the right to vote, the fight against male chauvinist behaviours, the representation of women in important political charges and the recognition of the sexuality in woman .
Nowadays, the Spanish Law penalizes sexual discrimination as for labour. The last sentences are becoming favourables to women. A few weeks ago, for instance, an enterprise has been charged with paying more money to men than to women, when both accomplished the same work. Other theme to be discussed is the women's right ~o vote, which has to do with the equality in the rights of the State. feminist pressures were used for the recognition of women's sufrage in Spain, in 1931. Besides, thanks to the fight of feminist groups, more reactionarity male shauvinist behaviours are denounced, the agressions are reported, and rapings are punished with greater severity, although there are exceptions, as always. To take an obvious example, a few years ago, and even today in some cases, the girl who wore a mini-skirt was the real guilty of her raping. Moreover, in the present political parties (especially in those which are situated in the center-left wing), women begin to be considered when taking important decisions. In an increasing way, women request more participation in the direction organs. In Spain we have three women who hold the charge of ministers in our government. But the world of women is still a dropout in the political world. At last, we must state that it is due to the feminist struggle that the sexuality of women is put on the same level as masculine one, and it is not so hidden. Before this, man could enjoy with his sex and be proud of his potency (or prepotency} whereas woman, had as her only function in society, that of procreating. With the sexual liberation, women advanced towards the knowledge and experimentation of their own body .
Therefore, the equality of wages, the right to vote, the consideration of women as inferior and less intelligents beings, the higher percentage of participation of women in charges with power of decision, and the fact of recognising their own sexuality are some of the consequences of the feminist fight since it, the oldest revolution of this century, began. Two weeks ago, I concentrated with some women to protest against two men who had raped a girl. They are free because she was scared and left to her country; therefore, the denounce has being stopped. Then the evidence is clear , there is no doubt that there was a rape, even from the point of view of the law. But in a legal way there is nothing to be done: only to demonstrate your rage for another injustice committed against women. This act has done more harm to the cause of women than good: from the rapers' point of view. That's why I am a militant feminist .
