Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
The clich√© that "money is the root of all evil ' has become in human history much more than a saying picked up by chance from an old song, but a reality which even more noticeable in modern times .
Money is generally regarded as a priceless key to unlock the slammed-shut doors which one encounters in daily life. Hence there is nothing that materialistic people would not be willing to do to obtain it. There exist positive means of earning money; working with endurance, integrity and good motivation seem to be the most worthy. Nevertheless exist other means of obtaining it which are not so honorable, but quicker. These means have become prominent in present day society .
These days society is evidently led by tendencies of consumption unknown before. During the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages and The lndustrial Revolution for instance, the boundaries between classes were completly separated and only a few fortunate members of the groups in power were aware of and could enjoy the delights wealthiness could provide. Today the means of communication transmit the excelencies of a glamorous world to those who find it hard to make ends meet. Hence the phrases ' I own", ' I possess" are becoming the guiding lights of a broad sector of society .
It is an unknown fact that to own and to posses one has to buy and that requires money. How does one find money? It is precisely at this point that evil is likely to make its apperance onto the stage especially because the cycle of money dictates that when money enters the hands of one it leaves the pocket of another. The trick is how to convince others to let loose their pockets. Even with in the limits of the legal methods of finding money there exist hidden tactics to seize the money of others. For instance, marketing is a means of making a piece of merchandise look wonderful and absolutely necessary for our existence, when the truth is the contrary. Are these methods of using propaganda in adverdsing to sell at all cost absolutely legal?.
However publicity and marketing are minor "crimes" when compared to violence, death, war, deprivation of human rights and other horrors which are aimed at the attainment of money, it seems that the value of human life diminishes as the value of money increases. It is then that homo lupu homini est may be applied to the definition of human behaviour. At this disgraceful view of human nature, man's blood stained hands rise proudly showing their ignominious award .
Nonetheless, it may be adduced that not always behind a violent act is an uncontainable lust for the acquisition of money or power. It may be alleged that nonmaterialistic ideological motives can prompt persons to get engaged in actions which endanger other people's basic rights even that of life. However, how many of those people do not conduct themselves by an ideal, but are subtly manipulated by the desires to accomplish the aims of an economical gain?.
In spite of all the vile acts and corruption which surround the world of money, it would be unfair not to acknowledge the altruistic purposes which lead some individuals or organisations to put their or other's money at the service of the needy ones .
These non-profit organisations are the most outstanding proof of the praisable actions which can be carried out thanks to money. Money can help to mitigate manu disabilities, calamities and much suffering where its lack is source of a continuous state of misfortune and afliction .
In conclusion, it must be taken into consideration that although the allure of money compells human beings to do wrong beyond any limits, in the long term money is neither good or bad itself but persons and their actions determine the role money play in the world .
