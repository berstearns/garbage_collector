Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is necessary in order to live in our modern society. It is obvious. Commerce and Economy are based upon money .
When people have little money, this money is more likely to be spent in primary needs (just to eat, dress; That's to say "to live").
The other way round can occur when money is easily obtained. I mean, when a person is rich from his birth .
I think that money gained without much effort is possibly to be spent inadequately. In these cases, money turns out to have little value, and rich people can often appear as money-slaves. These people may create some needs that don't really exist. And this is a closed circle in which they have to consume more and more, but without feeling pleasure in this consumerism .
Money can also be a vice. The one who has money wants more and more, and no-one is happy with what he-she has .
Money is not bad in itself. But the way one uses it can make noney appear as dangerous. Money is behind the majority of murders, assassinations, robberies, assaults...
Rich Nations-poor Nations: And here it comes the exploitation. It is a serious problem. Money is in between too .
This exploitation is specially dramatic when it has to do with children. There are lots of children without hope .
Within every poor country, there are a few people, mainly the Governors, who are very rich, while the rest of the country is dying because of staruation, lack of water, diseases such as diarrhea and deshidration, due to contaminated food and water. Measles and tetanus, along with diphtheria, whooping cough, polio and other diseases, are preventable through immunization, again relatiuely cheap .
Countries spend great amounts of money on military expenditures and, at the same time, people live at or below the poverty line .
If this trend continues, millions of children will die, most of them unnecessarily, of illness or famine, or malnutrition .
There is a neglection by Governments, more preoccupied with politics, guns and national debt, and they doesn't care .
Some children, to escape from misery, have to work from a very early age. But the people uho employ them doesn't care. In some cases, the types of work these children are offered, are very risky ones .
The majority of them are low paid. They must work to stay alive. They have no option .
Drugs are also a very serious problem, and it is in some way, related to money as well. Drug adicts need money in order to buy drugs. And it's a great business for drug-dealers .
Experts note that passport and inmigration controls have never been very helpful in stopping drug-dealers .
Inmigration is due to lack of resources, lack of resources, lack of money as well. Poor people cross borders to escape from poverty. Although they know it can be risky, they take these big risks. For example, people from Cuba try to go to The United States by boat, and the same happens to people from Morocco trying to go to Spain by boat. Some of them die; others are taken back to their countries, and those who have better luck, succeed in their purpose .
They look for a better life, but it is not very easy. They'll find a lot of troubles and problems, specially at the beginning. Then, they'll get used to their new life, and things will go better for them .
