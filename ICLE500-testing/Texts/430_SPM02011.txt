Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Just a few words before...
When we speak about feminism we always get very different opinions, even among those who call themselves feminists. Some of these opinions can sometimes be controversial. Considering myself a non - archetypal feminist, my own opinions could happen to be a bit contradictory sometimes .
The examples I'll mention in this essay will be mainly referred to feminism in Spain and England, as I have more points of reference with regard to this two countries .
Talkinq about feminism .
One of the most important protest campaigns in Britain was the Suffragette Movement. At the beginning of this century women couldn't vote in British elections. The Suffragettes wanted to change this. We will never know how successful the Suffragettes were, because in 1914 the First World War started and the protests were stopped. During the war many men's jobs were done by women, because men were in the army. The war changed people's ideas about many things. When it ended in 1918 the vote was given to all men over twenty - one and to women over the age of thirty. A few years later it was given to all adults over the age of twenty-one .
There has been similar movements in other countries and women have been, little by little, gaining ground. But it's still true in some places that women have to carry on jobs which, historically, have always been asigned to males, like farming, working in the fields, etc, and have, at the same time, to do the housework, taking care of the kids, etc .
It's not only in the country that women have to develop these multiple roles. An average family nowadays consists on a "he", who, whether has or doesn't have a job, uses to let all the housework be done by "her", and occasionally gives a hand in enough simple tasks to keep his brain safe against headaches; and a "she', who can sometimes stupidly assure, very proudly, she is a "superwoman", and therefore can afford all sacrifice and work twenty five hours a day, going to work, taking care of "he" and the kids, and showing everybody her shiny kitchen, and taking his time as well, to do the shopping, having coffee (or whatever) with her mates, and ocasionally having time to spend with a nice lover that offers her all that necessary things (???) that "he" can not give her .
This examples only come to show there is still a lot of work to be done, and what real feminists should try do do first is to change female's mind, and then do the same with the male's, ' cos there's no way we could change something unfair if we, women, are not the first ones who become aware of what is fair or not, and the only way of stopping them patronizing us, either considering us as fragile china miniatures, or simple "bimbos" (sexual objects whith an absolute lack of brains).
And that's why, in my opinion, the first feminists did a lot of good to the cause of women, getting for us at least to be considered as people (that is, animals with a brain able to think and decide, for instance, which politician would, in our opinion, do less harm to our country).
Feminism nowadays is another story, specially when talking about Spain. Objectives are not that clear, victories are not that convincing and there are some not too obvious points, like the abortion law, even for some who consider themselves as feminists. This law was a victory of feminism in England a long time ago. In fact, if that country advantages us in something, it is in showing consideration for women and respecting and even imposing women's rights, although it's still a long way off the day we will see thousand of us elected to ministers, to Parliament and the European Parliament, the day we won't suffer any kind of discrimination .
Anyway, although I don't think feminists are doing any harm to the cause of women, I do believe the kind of propaganda some feminist groups of them use to display is not effective at all. Each womann has to realise she can fight her particular battle on her own, not showing everybody how week they are and joining groups to get stronger .
