Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
It's obvious that the governments of all the countries in the world have to defend people from all those those things that endanger not only their lives but also their possessions .
All through the history of mankind there have been several ways of punishing murderers and thieves, depending on the different cultures, races and religions of that specific group of people. But I am not going to talk about the past. What I am going to talk about is the fact that today, at the door of the 21st century, men haven't been able to find a humane way of solving this problem .
Nowadays, when a person is found guilty of murder or robbery, three things may happen to him/her: 	- be released from prison by paying bail .
-be sent to prison for a shorter or longer time .
-be killed (death penalty).
Of course, the third possibility is the least frequent, but it is sometimes carried out (more in some countries than in others) and, in my opinion, it shouldn't. It would be extremely risky to put someone to death because we can never be sure whether a person is completely guilty of a crime. I'd think of life inprisonment as a last resort, but trying to rehabilitate the criminal, not abandoning him/her in a locked room .
I read somewhere, I don't remember in which newspaper or book exactly, that some of the murderers who are killed on the electric chair in the U.S.A. are mentally ill. I prefer not to investigate whether it is true. I would get depressed .
We must neither punish murderers nor send them to prison. We are all responsible for the existence of crimes and robberies in the world and we are the only ones who have the power to turn murderers in human beings. If they kill because they are crazy, we will take them to a hospital to take care of them, not to the electric chair. If they kill because of political reasons, jealousy, longings for power of money, etc... we will have to rehabilitate them, not to punish them. Death penalty and life inprisonment will never reduce the number of crimes (I even think that the number would increase).
The only problem is that this way of dealing with criminals requires a lot of money and a big effort on the part of the society, but I think that both the expenses and the effort would be worth .
Apart from all this, I'd like to add that the current prison system we have in Spain makes rich people not to spend more than three nights in prison. They are usually released in a few days by paying bail. Let's remember how many days Mariano Rubio spent in prison .
Therefore, the society is letting people with a lot of economic power take advantage of a system that perhaps was created by themselves, and this means that the society is controlled by them, because unfortunately, the ones who have the money are the same as the ones who have the social, political and ideological power over the entire society .
In short, the current prison system is not only OUTDATED but also completely UNFAIR.
A fair distribution of goods and a higher level of civic education will undoubtedly make a much better world .
