Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
It has usually been said that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good. This may be true, but had it been ever thought the reasons of this assertion? First, I would like to make a distinction between the concepts of "liberated woman" and "feminist": The former is the woman who has realized of her condition in this world and tries to improve it without wanting to replace men, whereas the latter is more radical and wants to replace men .
Men had always been considered as the only one source of income and, therefore, of some stability in the family. This comes from the early times of the Humankind in the world and the constitution of the family. Since men were much stronger than women, they were suposed to be hunters for the group, whereas women were suposed to take care of the family, to take care of the "home fire".
It is very difficult to have the certain knowledge about how their feelings were developped and how all these feelings became what they were centuries ago and they are nowadays. We can see it in the language. The human beings have always felt the necessity of talking to others, which was stronger when they started to hunt. Language evolved very quickly, then. However, we cannot think that language evolved in the same way for men and women, as men must use a certain type of vocabulary related to hunt and animals, whereas women's vocabulary related to home, fire, etc .
Jointly with the question of language, a certain personality was developped, too. Thus, women were less socialbe than men were because they didn't need to communicate themselves outside their homes as much as their partners. So, from those times up to very recent times (we must remember the Middle Ages), women have been suposed to be silent, discreet and friendly:silent and discreet because it wasn't considered as well that a woman spoke and told great things about philosophy, etc.; friendly with the men, above all. It is a very complicate way of feeling. They must think that a friendly, complaissant woman gave them the rest they need: when the hunter came back to his cavern, he, a primitive man, would find a sort of real rest and home into this cavern, beside the less sociable, with a worse easiness to communicate woman and then, they got used to it, making an idealization of their partners .
The problem was that later women became sociable than before; this silent and prudence was beginning to disappear as well as men's structures. Woman have always had a very difficult access to the world of knowledge. The ones who wanted to investigate and become doctors were called witches; a woman writer is very difficult to find until the XVIII and XIX centuries. She couldn't say what she tought in public: a woman had to be silent. Men evolved, but they kept with themselves this idealization as a rest of their old work as hunters and family supporters. However, this work is not so old: they still were the strongest; the only ones who could work and say great things were them. Fortunately, the world has being continually changing, and nowadays we cannot think of such conditions of life for women, although there is still a rest of all this in our present world .
As the world was changing and women were feeling the necessity of communicate themselves, basicly in order to improve their life conditions, they had to use another language and therefore, change the structures long-time stablished. This was considered a man's work. We must remember the "fin ' amor", in which man had to challenge the marriage structure; later, it became a structure in the Middle Ages .
Unfortunately, not only men had this structure: women had it, too. The mothers or grandmothers tried to make young girls follow it. So liberated woman had a double work to do:fight against men and fight against other woman carried it, too and try to make them realize of their bad situation. And because it was not an easy task for them to do, they had to persist very much in their aim. So the adoption of a language and behaviour strange in the female sex and the perseverance which they carried it with, had the whole world to marginalize them. Yet, the world got nothing because women continued defending their ideas. They often had to do it very hard against other human beings. This led some women to want to be in the places occupied by man, firstly, Men's "ego" got very hurt and so this prevailed until right now .
