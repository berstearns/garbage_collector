Most University degrees are theoritical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are, therefore, of very little value. Students graduates with excelents academic curriculums are not enough prepared for the job that it is supposed thay have to develop, because in most universities there isn't any practise at all, practically the whole of the classes are thoretical and fills the student mind with a lot of knowledge that, in the most of the cases are not practise. In fact, when these excelents students finish their degrees and go to asking for a job they are always asked the same question: "and, what do you know to do?, do you have any experience or any practise?". The answer in the most of the cases are "No".
There are some Universities that can not to offer any practise to their students for several reasons: first, there are too much students, and they can not offer practise to all of them. Second, this practise implies a cost that many Universities can not pay. Another reason is that private enterprises sometimes don't want to proporcionate facilities to the University for their student's practices, but, maybe, it is not a problem of the University but the private enterprise. In the cases that this enterprises accept students for doing practices, these students are not payed at all, and they are taking the job of the other people. The students are sometimes exploted, and therefore, they are not motivated. These preactices are not such practices in some cases, because the enterprises don't let the student to asume any responsability and s/he doen't learn very much. Sometimes the practices are not related with their degrees .
The University should be prepared for proporcionate all the students the necessary practice for developing their future work in the best way possible. In scientifices degrees, for instance, is very important that the student had enough practice. Do you imagine an engineer that does't knew what is a screw?!. It must seem like a joke, and it is exagerate, of couse, but it is true that students of scientific degrees haven't seen a laboratory the enough times that they need .
In the Humanities degrees the situation is worse, if it can be. These students have a very few practice. They have to memorize too much theory that it is useless. In degrees like Laws, the students have to memorize all the codes, all the laws, the civil law, the labour law, the criminal law, and so on. The lawyers don't need all this things because they are all in the books. On the other hand, they need to practice their knowledge in order not to forget it, and for being objectives in their work, and, in sum, for being a good lawyer. The students of Laws don't have any practice in their degrees, but they are exiged two years of experience to enter to the laboral world. How can we explain it?
In studies of languages, the University doesn't proporcionate the students enough facilities for studying in a country in which the language they are learning is spoken. That is essential for the preparation of the student. The student have to search and to pay for their studies in other countries in the most of the cases, excepting all those very good students, of course .
In fact, the practice is adquired with the years, and one is better in his/her job with the years of experience, however, one must have a minimun of practice when s/he finish his/her degree. Some degrees are too long and of very little value, in some cases is a waste of time to be in theUniversity five or six years, studying something that it is not usefull at all. I think that is urgent to find a solution for this problem. The world demands new graduates with a lot of characteristics and qualities that the graduate doesn't have because the University hasn't given it. That is not for the own graduate's blame, but the Educational System, the Goverment, or I don't know the really blamer of this situation, but, one thing is clear: it is needed a reform urgently .
