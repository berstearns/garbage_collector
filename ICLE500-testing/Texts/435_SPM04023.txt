Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good .
I think that feminists have contributed to the improvements in the life of women .
At the beggining of this century, women in Britain couldn't vote, stand in public office, enter any of the professions or most well-paid jobs, be awarded a university degree, control their fertility, or share guardianship of their children. The brave women who campaigned for these rights were ridiculised and those who took vident actions were imprisoned. The campaign of these women over many years eventually won them equal rights. They were fighting not onlythe prejudices of their own times, but a legacy of thought which had for centuries defined women as inherently inferior to men and sought to control them by making them the virtual property of their fathers and husbands .
From the early 1890s, the debate about the lack of political rights of women was a live issue on which most people had an opinion. Two groups of women made sure that women's suffrage was kept in the public eye .
The suffragists believed that law'abiding campaigning and appeal to reasonableness in men would eventually win women the vote. Led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett, they organised a network of local National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, arranged meetings and rallies, lobbied Parliament and published their own newspaper .
There were militant suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union, led by Emmeline and Christobbel Pankhurst, were more impatient with the lack of progress for women and organised more dramatic demonstrations. On Derby Day 1913, one suffragette, Emily Davidson, threw herself under the King''s horse and was killed .
However, in the event, it took a world war to win British women the vote. Both wings of the suffrage movement encouraged women to engage in war work. Women responded in large numbers and by the end of the war 90% were doing work done by men, though far less pay. Having landed their efforts, it was difficult for the Government to deny them political rights, though initially the vote was only granted to women over 30, so they wouldn't outnumber male voters. It was necessary ten years before women won the vote on the same terms as men .
Women have for a long time been active in the organisations which have grown up to improve and protect the environment in which we live, physical and social .
Thereare now around ten million women in paid employment. Many women work part time. Those who work full time earn an averaged two-thirds as much as men. There are fewer women involuntarily unemployed .
Jobs done mainly or wholly by women are paid relatively low rates, perhaps because they are done by women whose bargaining powers have been relatively weak. Women work less overtime .
In education the great majority of class teachers in the primary schools are women. In 1960 a quarter of all university students were women .
The new women graduates of the 80s and 90s will probably soon change the balance of the sexes in the higher jobs .
