Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The aim of the present essay is to explain what reasons provoke nowadays the lack of dreaming and imagination in our society. In the modern world the advances in technology and industralization have imposed a particular life style that has provoked that people scarcely have time to do what they would like to. In spite of this, people find some time to do it .
First of all, I'd like to point out the importance in the present time of the incorporation of high technology in most of jobs. New techniques are incorporated; for example, in the case of computers, new programs are created to facilitate the way people work. These incorporations oblige people to learn new things very frecuently in order to be prepare enough; so, besides of learning, they have to work and (usually in the case of women) they have to attend the house also .
In consequence to this, people are very busy and tired. Moreover, the pressure at work provoke competence between the workers. So they are worried because they have to work hard in order to get a promotion or simply in order to keep the job. This tense situation creates anxiety, stress and nervousness .
The next reason is related to the developments of cities in the modern world. Most of people live far from the inner city and they have to drive to the place they work in. So, everyday they have to wake up very early and have to suffer the huge traffic jams during at least one hour, what produces anxiety and nerves again. On the other hand, if they live near the inner city they will have to wait for the subway or the buses in the crowed platforms during the peak hours, if they decided not to take the car in order to arrive sooner at work .
All I have mentioned before implies that people are frecuently very tired at the end of a working day. All they want to do in this situation, when they finally arrive at home, is try to sleep .
This frenetic life style has made people worried about promotions, money, new techniques etc, and it seems like if they were no longer worried about anything else. But, in spite of this, I think people still today spend some time dreaming or imaginig. Everybody needs time to relax thinking about a good place to do to in vacation. Everybody needs to forget the stress and to escape, at least for a while, from pressure, hurry, noises, smoke... Otherwise, they wouldn't go to see films from time to time, they wouldn't read novels, they wouldn't travel or they wouldn't walk with a friend .
In fact, these frecuent activities is what most of people life to do in their free time. All of these imply dream or imagine in some way. This prove that eventhough our modern world imposes us a busy and stressed life people find time to do what they like to .
To sums up, all I have mentioned before lead us to the conclusion that if our lifes were a little "easier" and we wouldn't be dominated by a world that is constantly changing, due to new techniques and industrialization, we could enjoy doing things as dream and imagine more frecuently. Dreaming and imagining are human "necessities" and still in our stressed lifes we can go it; at least during the weekend or in vacation .
