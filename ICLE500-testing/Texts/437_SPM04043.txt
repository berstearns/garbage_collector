Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
I can only say that this statement is completely true. I agree with this so much that I could not avoid choosing this topic. I am at a working with computers or other kinds of "modern technology". Well, maybe it is just that I am not really interested in learning much about it. Technology is the future and I recognize this. I know that, in the end, I will have to learn just like everyone else .
Technology has gone so far that the question is: Where does the man end and where does the machine start?. I do not want to be pessimistic, but progress is transforming us into machines. Nowadays, we do not think for ourselves. Everything is already done for us. It used to be that it was our brains that did the work. People used their imagination trying to explain misteries without visible solutions. Now, it seems like people have become tired of doing so much work in a day with only 24 hours. One of the principal roots of the problem is time. People felt that they did not have enough time so they invented computers to help them out. However, despite the additional help of the computers, people feel as pressed for time as ever. It seems that we spend so much time trying to get the computer to do what we tell it to that it would be easier if we just did the work ourselves. It is a long time since there has been no room for dreaming and imagination in society, and, in 1996, still less .
Can we imagine a world without computers or without advanced technology?. Could people survive?. Personally, I think that I could. Just imagine for a minute that we have gone back to the 17th century. It is the century in which the first novels were published. People dreamt about them and they imagined fantastic vorlds where they were the heroes and the heroines of stories of wonder. They knew nothing about computers and I am sure that they were as happy as we are. I am not saying that industrialization is necessarily a bad thing. On the contrary!. The question is finding the balance between the time we spend dreaming, and say the time we spend enjoying some computer game .
Another subject that I think is important is the relationship between children and technology. When I was a child, I used to read short stories or watching cartoons. I was happy. Nowadays, children depend on television more than my generation did. They do not watc wholesome shows like Sesame Street anymore; instead, they watch shows based on violence like Power Rangers. They do not have time for dreaming because they are always in front of the television or playing with the Game Boy. Maybe this is their way of dreaming but everything that comes to their eyes is violence. The computer games are about fighting or race cars... Children like these games because they are the most entertaining. Does technology and progress promote competition between children?. Maybe it does but I think it would be a sad way to encourage competition. If the younger generations do not know anything about dreaming, how can we blame them?. They have not been taught by their parents but my machines. I believe that with the passage of the time, we will be dominated more and more by the very machines we thought would be of help .
To conclude I have to say that when I hear the words "dreaming" and "imagination", I think of books, of films, of all those fantastic realities that still survive. Of course there is still a place for these things in our everyday life. What we have to do is to be careful not to let computers gain ground .
