Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
From the beggining of the society there are the problem of the money. All the people wants to be richer than his neighbour. People accept jobs according to how many they pay him but not according to his preferences. People tends to think that the more important is the money but they tell you that it is the health .
Money is the real problem of the society in this world, because it determines the great real problem in the society nowadays: the avarice. But it is not a problem that only appears now, but it is a problem who begins since the man is a man. When the man thought like an animal, he still have the instinct of survice, with no matters if other person lived better than him. He changed his elephant peel for a hen, without thinking if, maybe, the the peel could have more value than the hen. He thought: "I needs this hen in order to survive, and, as I don't need this elephant peel I could change it". But, in a indeterminated moment of the history of the human beings - it would be interesting that the cameras had record this moment-, one man said "my peel is most value than your hen, if you want me to give you this peel, you will have to give me two of your hens" - even knowing that it would be worse for the three children of the man. This poor man accept the change, and from this moment begins the avarice. This fact could make us thing that the real guilty of the beginning of the greed was... the man who accepted the first avaricious treat, but it would be accept that all the humanity is guilty and... it's so true .
It's so true because only a very rather small group of people has denied to following the rule of the greeds. And we can see it along the history of the humanity, and it is the reason why we following with the rough history of the world .
The people who begin to restore the avarice in the world sow that the best vehicle to keep that has born: the money. We can think that the reason of the creation of the money was good, in order to value the things you need and to prevent people to buy things according to its prize, but as the good ideas uses to finish in bad results, as we can see with the invention of the powder, the result is a invention, that instead of help society, damage it .
People left his desires and became to work in those work where they can buy more money. This wasn't very dangerous if some people doesn't follow this parameters, but the 99% of the population of the world begin to believe to this way of live "less pleasure and more money". This situation produces that people who coudn't earn the same money as their neighbours, get greed, and even they would not tell you nothing about it, they didn't mind if their neighbours didn't earn so much money .
But this fact doesn't finish here, because people, when they have a relevant and important work, they treats to better their entrances making "dark business". This phenomenon is relevant nowadays, as we can see in countries as Spain, Itally, EE.UU. or Great Britain, where politics, don't agree of what they want, prefer to put in dangerous his liberty in order to buy a luxury apartment with two hundred bathrooms. Then people thinks: "if the politics, who had teorically to be honest, because they represent the whole country, they don't, then, why I cant do it!". Then, people begins to declare to the government less than they really earns, and the snow ball begins to be more and more big .
Children will born in this state of greed, and from the beginning, they will prefer the money instead of the love of his family and this will produce a lost of the old values, than, even when we thinks that this values don't help us and it would have to be changed by new values, they help us to keep a bit of humanity in our souls .
If this ball keeps its rhythm, we will return back to the wilderness, because wars will be more frequent than nowadays, and we will live as animals, with only a diference, animals never hurts animals of his own blood .
