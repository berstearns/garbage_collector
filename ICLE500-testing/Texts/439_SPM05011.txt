Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
The aim of this paper is to discuss whether the prison sy system is outdated and what should a civilised society do with its criminals to rehabilitate them . Does prison system rehabilitate indeed ? What are convicts situation within the prison like ? Is there a real alternative to rehabilitate criminals ? Why does public opinion show no interest at all in this subject ? In my opinion it is quite clear that there must be found new means to deal with such a serious problem .
According to researchs , studies , and statistics , most of the criminals are not rehabilitated by means of prison system , since during their time in prison , they are isolated from the rest of the world and society . Logically , that is not the best way of rehabilitating criminals for the society , by isolating him or her . Nevertheless , when criminals are released , they find themselves even more isolated than they were before . The isolation is due to people behaviour to them ; they are notsupported but rejected . Once they get out of prison , they find it difficult to integrate into society again so they have agreat deal of problems such as getting a job , and so on . Some former convicts' testimonies say that they do not feel very confident , and confortable when joining the society again . That is way the only solution for many of them is crime , breaking the law; thus probably , getting back to prison .
Everybody knows that a great majority among imprisoned people are drugs addicted and some of them being seriously sick , even infected with AIDS . Some of this sick people are there because of their addiction . In many places they do not have appropiate medical care . There are differences between people imprisoned in the so-called third world , and those in the developed countries . Although , that should not be a reason to support prison system whereever it were . Those people imprisoned in the underdeveloped world , are living under subhuman conditions ; thousands of people piles up , struggling with hunger and without health guarantees al all . Besides this , in these places human rights are not taken into account .
It is obvious , there is no interest , neither authorities nor on citizens part , in solving this question or in presenting it to public opinion . So , we have got to wonder what is the reason for it . I suppose , the reason could be that neither conservative nor liberal people are interested in having criminals wandering around , thus being a threat for society . The society would be more confident having criminnals in a safe place , therefore , there would be no risk for anybody . I am sure, a great majority agree with the idea that prison is the best place for criminals to be and that there would be no better place for those breaking the law . Evenmore in some places still exist popularly supported death penalty. It is obvious that in in that places there is the thought that the prison system is outdated; ; since , those nations get rid of its criminals . So the conlusion is : the more criminals staying imprisoned , the better for the society . There is the feeling that once crimminnals have infringed law , they do not belong to society anymore . According to this toughts, politicians do not include the prison system question in their electioneering , at least including progressists proposals . Supporting such ideas is unpopular and would not be good for their images . Even , most of them may think there is no need to change prison system .
As far as I am concerned , there are not many proposals saying how rehabilitate criminals abolishing prison system . The proposals held , such as , engaging those infringing law in social works , are not accepted , indeed . In spite of it , we should continue supporting that imprisonment is not the right way of facing this problem . As we have seen , the solutions is quite difficult to find , evenmore when nobody looks for it. Maybe we should wonder what is going wrong with our society , when it produces people having to survive by any means necessary , even outside the law .
