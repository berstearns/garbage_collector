Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
In our society, an university degree is becoming more and more important each day as it is very difficult to find a job, especially for young people .
You are asked for an university degree in many jobs, even though this has nothing to do with the work you must carry out .
This is the mean reason, I think, because of people, nowadays, want to take an university degree .
The problem is that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. In most of cases, when you start in a new job, you are lost because although you have a good formation, this is a theoretical formation and probably will not be as useful as it should be. What most of firms do is to impart the courses that are needed in a particular job .
I think that people should be formed in a more practical way when they are studing at university, so they can put into practice what they have learned in their theoretical lessons. In my opinion, this is one of the better ways of learning .
However, in our educational system, this is very difficult because one of its greatest problems is the lack of money, and money is essential as it is necessary for the manteinance and improvement of the laboratories, the informatic rooms, etc, and for everything that is needed for a good practical formation at the university; and to realize another practical tasks outside the university (in a firm, in a museum, in a factory or in anywhere).
This is the reason because many people have to complete their education, after having finished university, with complementary courses or masters in relation with the career they have studied which, in the most of cases are not free, and eve many of them are so expensive that only a few people can study them. This makes that not everyone has the same oportunities when they are looking for a job, because if you have a master or a prestigious course in your curriculum vitae, you have more posibilities to be employed that if you don't .
In spite of all these reasons showed, I don't think that university degrees are of very little value, because they are very useful as a good formation .
"University is the school of life". As this saying, I think that, in some way, university is the school of life, although this should be applied to the university of some years ago, when it was more difficult to take an university degree because parents could not afford to send their children to study at university .
Nowadays university is not the school of life in the same way as it was a time before, because it has become a school where many people study to pass and to take an university degree, and only a little minority studies to learn, to acquire a solid formation and to prepare to real world .
I would like to say to conclude that, in my opinion, university degrees are of a great value as an academic degree and also as an important advantage when you are looking for a job, because, in most of cases, you will find it before than you have not an university degree .
