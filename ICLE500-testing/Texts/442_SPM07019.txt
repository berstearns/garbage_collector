Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Our modern world is dominated by science technology and industrialisation. Many years ago, the men and women, were ruled by the forces of nature. They had to work very hard in order to survive the dangers of the nature. They had to hunt, for getting food. They depended of the weather, for being comfortable and hot. In case they had some disease, they would die, because they had not knowledge of medicine. They thought that the storms, the illnesses or any other power of the nature were prices or punishments of the Gods for being good or bad .
Most of the time, they lived afraid, or working or fighting against their hungry, their thirsty, and their illnesses. Fighting against their need of hot, and shelter, in order to protect them from the natural elements like the storms, the wild animals, the absence of food and water, and other "natural" disasters .
Usually they were always occupied with these hard tasks and dind't have any time for thinking or dreaming. In my opinion, their only dream how surviving this day and the next, this hour and the next, this minute and the next, this second and the next. Such was their fear and anxiety that they couldn't think in another thing than to stay alive one minute more .
In case they were quiet and without any danger, probably they could think and eat and sleep quietly, and in that case, they could dreaming and thinking about how to get food and store it, in order to protect them against the rain, the storms, the wind, the cold, the wild animals, and many others natural elements that threatened their lives .
So the humankind, began to habit in caves, discovered the fire and used them to warm themselves, and to drive away savage creatures. They invented primary weapons wich allowed them hunting more easily. So they had more free time for sleeping, eating talking between them and of course thinking and dreaming .
The more free time they had, the more they thought and dreamed, and the more thing they discover or invented .
In that sense, the progress of the humankind, has been continuous, but slow .
The human societies have been every century, more and more complicated. While some persons dedicated their time at hard woks, like building temples pyramids, palaces, houses, etc, others had more free time for thinking, dreaming and inventing more devices that gave them more free time .
In the last two centuries, the progress of the humankind has been vertiginous, specially in western societies. Every decade, more and more persons have more free time, and the hard jobs, is done by machines. In the last fifty years, every year, the men and women dedicate more time to intellectual task, and less time to manual and hard works. The expectation of life is longer and longer, and men and women have more time to invent, think, imagine, dream etc .
In that sense, I think that science, technology and industrialisation have done more opportuneness for dreaming and imagination .
