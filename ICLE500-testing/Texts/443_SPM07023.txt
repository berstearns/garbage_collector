Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
In the words of the old song "Money is the root of all evil".
It's not exactly what headline said, I think, but some of this is true .
We know God told to the man that he would earn his food with swear of his forehead; in other words, without work there isn't food. We must understand that food is between all necessyties men have. Consecuently everything men have more than they need are for their amusement .
And here is where starts the trouble .
It's very good for men all kinds of amusements but when their amusements are more than thoses they need men start to try other things generally prohibitive. And Â¿why men try to find other things they don't need? ... Because he has money .
There are lot of things men can buy, can do, can try, can ... etc... that aren't necessary either. But if men haven't money they can't do prohibitive things .
On the other hand, wasting more money meaning way to try to obten more. so it's going to be a circle that can not end .
Then come the necessity to earn more and in this way it goes to ambition, and ambition is blind when it takes root in the man .
There is anything can stop then when men are blind with ambition .
We have heard sometimes that who has too much likes to have more and more and we always want more and more, because ambition never find his end .
Solution for that kind of problem is given for us by lot of very prominent persons who tell us that in the middle way is where we can find virtue. So if we have more money we need what we have to do is to invent, to spend in something to help people or to make lif better. Why there are wars ... why there are hungries...
It's not because there aren't money but because we don't distribute well money .
But it is true that sometimes we have more money because it gives us security and, importance, etc... and we don't like lose that because if we lose that other will be over us. We have fear too. And it is true that when some people lose their ones gain .
How many wars, how many problems have had men with money...
After a war men think, are more careful and goods are better distributed; but little by little, step by step, ambition gives taken root in men again .
It is a very serious thing to think about. We all have to contribute for that. We all have to take mesures to solve the problems in the best way we can .
Every rich country helping the poor one; every rich man to the poor one too. And not only with money but in all kind of things although money can solve lot of them .
