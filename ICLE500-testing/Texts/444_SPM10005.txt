Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value .
Nowadays, most of young people go to the university; some of them go there because of the prestige, others are obliged by their parents and so on .
There is just only a minority who decides to study practical subjects such as plumbing or carpentry. These kind of students know from the very beginning that the aim of their studies is to be prepared for the real world .
On the other hand, students, who go to the university, think that they are going to learn theoretical and practical aspects of their subjects. It is supposed that they will be experts in the matter of their studies at the end of the course .
However, most of universities give theoretical rather than practical lessons, maybe because it requires an explanation, books, fotocopies ... Material which is finally considered easy to acquire. But give practical lessons is a difficult matter, because it requires specific didactic material, small groups of students, laboratories, etc .
Actually, there are some agreements between big companies and universities; they give the opportunity to some students to work as assistants. But the number of vacancies is limited and lots of students apply for it .
What happens with the rest of students?
They have to look for some training by their own, in this sense, they are confused because they do not know how to prepare a curriculum vitae, to which department they must go or how to make an interview and so on, so forth .
Although problems go on, when you find a job you are Iost because you have lots of information, but you do not know how to use it. For example a teacher knows things about teaching, but he/she does not know how to talk to the pupils. Or a doctor is an expert in medicine, but he/she does not know how to treat his/her patients .
In this sense, you can observe that theoretical knowledges must be supported by practical cases. However, these practical cases take you a lot of time and maybe you can not go every day to the university, and then you have a lack of theoretical knowledges. In other words, there must be an equilibrium between theoretical and practical lessons .
The lack of balance is directly related to some studies, but even more, students are not really prepared for the real world in any matter, for example, most of them do not know how to open a bank account and so on, so forth .
Finally, it does not know which is the best solution, the problem could be a lack of money, the system...
In spite of all these problems students go still to the university .
