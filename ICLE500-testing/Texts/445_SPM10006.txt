Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
In the past, it is true that those people who had university studies could get a good job easily, mainly because there were not many people in the University due to economic reasons. Another important aspect is that there was not such a variety of studies and almost everybody became teacher, doctor, lawyer,... no matter if the degrees were based on theory. So, it was more a question of prestige .
Nowadays, finding a job is not that casy and lt is becoming more and more difficult even if you have recelved an universlty education. One of the causes of this problem could be the way university degrees are structured .
lt is supposed that university degrees should he geared to professional future. Since many of those degrees have several openings, in my opinion, there should exist a practical specialization for each of these openings and therefore, students would finish knowing what they will have to do when they find a job. lt is obvious that to get this aim, the syllabus should be checked and corrected, or even, rewritten .
The ideal way of studying could be giving just the necessary theoretical keys so as to be able to apply them in practical situations, the more similar to reality, the better. For instance, in the case of language university studies, the syllabus should include, at least, one subject on that language per year, since languages are changing all the time and besides, by not practising it, students forget basically, vocabulary and expressions .
As far as my personal experience as an university student is concerned, I find necessary to have a deep look into the whole syllabus in order not to repeat any subjects, to reduce the number of them, to organize them in a way that the study of them is logical, whether it is chronological or simply a question of sense and, of course, to include a number of hours dedicated to practice .
For instance, lt is the case of that student of Chemistry who has never been to a laboratory. He/she may know all the formula and theoretic explanations, but, when dealing with a real experiment or investigation project, reallze that he or she is not sure of which formula to apply. Or the situation of someone studying journalism who has never been, for example, to a radio programme .
lt is true that some degrees also consist of practical training in enterprises, schools, hospitals or wherever, as long as it is related to the studies, but there are many more which are just theoretical. The trouble is very serious because when you flnlsh your studies and have to ' face up to the world', you realize that the first thing you are asked in an application for a job is lf you have worked in that field before. Of course, if you are in your early twenties, lt is very probable that you have never had an employment. However, all those people who have had practical training after their studies can say they have experience or even have the possibility of keeping on working in that enterprise where they took their practical lessons .
Recently, there are the so-called ' Módulos', which are more concrete and aimed at a specific professional opening. From my point of view, they are quite well structured, since they are about two years long and you do not obtain your title unless you fulfil a certain number of hours of practical training in real entreprises and dealing with cases of the real life .
As a conclusion, I would like to say that nowadays, to have an university degree is not a question of prestige but, practically, a need, since when looking for an employment, you are required as many titles as possible. Thus, the ordeno of the studies should be better established so that the title would correspond exactly to our level of knowledge, and thís includes practical knowledge .
(NOTE: Although I do not agree very much with the syllabus of rny studies, I want to say that I like what I am doing.)
