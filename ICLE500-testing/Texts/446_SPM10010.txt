Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Feminism can not be considered as a movement with a concrete beginning and a concrete developement. There has always been something of a feminist in all those women who all along the history did not submit to their excluding role of mothers and wives. Women who aspired to get something more in life than a happy husband and a tidy home .
Unfortunately, during many centuries those women were not understood, not only by men, but also by other women. Other women, whose minds had been so deeply influenced by society, and by society here I mean men, that they had get to believe that was their only place in life, that they were not independent persons with own aspirations and objectives .
Women have always been opressed, in different ways and different degrees, and ignored as valid "thinkers" and "doers", and still are today. This situation, as all unnatural and forced situations, was condemned to explote one day or another .
Although, as it has been mentioned before, feminist tendences have been observed in all periods and societies, it can be considered that the movement as such was born at the end of the eighteenth century in the frame of the French Revolution. Feminism was, from its origin, a social doctrine that admitted that women have the same capacities and, therefore, the same rights as men .
The majority of women never questioned the position that had been imposed to them, and accepted it as normal and natural, overall because nobody ever asked them for their opinions and so, they did not feel in the right to express them. But after centuries of opression and unjustice some women started to think that maybe they also had something to say, not only about their own situation but about life as a whole: politics, history, economy...
Obviously, these new proposals, and even exigences, carried out by these women were not listened nor respected. And it was then when they had to start fighting to defend those rights that they considered they have and that society was denying them. Their ideals were vindicated with words, but as these words did not produce any effect they started to be expressed by deeds, and often, violently. Violence can hardly be justified but sometimes it is the only mean to be listened and taken in consideration. All groups of opressed people, all minorities in some moment or another had to recur to extreme means, as violence, to attract attention, to be heard, and so did feminists .
As all social movements, feminism had some radical and extreme manifestations, women who thought that in order to defend their rights and ideas it was necessary to reject men. This led to a misinterpretation of both the term and the movement, and because of that, many people (of both genders) during many years have had a wrong concept of what feminism was, and is nowadays, and have thought that feminists were just a group of crazy women or lesbians (or crazy lesbians) who thought men should be eliminated from the Earth because they were all unfair, uncivilised and unnecessary and, of course, inferior to women .
And that has nothing to do with reality because a movement that is trying to prove that women are equal to men can not be claiming that men are inferior than women. If the aim of feminism would have been to demonstrate that women are better than men, it would have been excluding one of the genders again and, therefore, placing women in an isolated position once more, which is exactly what they were trying to avoid .
So, this interpretation of feminism is wrong, and has been the one which has given the term a negative and peyorative aspect, and maybe, according to this interpretation "feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good". But if we consider feminism as what it actually is, it can not be denied that it has done much more good than harm .
