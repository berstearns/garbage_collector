Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Our world today does look a lot different from the world a hundred years ago. Not only are there more people populating the earth but the terms of existing have also changed rapidly. To people in the western world these changes have usually meant that new technologies have been introduced, mostly in order to facilitate life. There is no denying that much of the technology has facilitated life. For example cars and planes, but also telephones have shortened the distances and made places accessible with, relatively speaking, little loss of time. If we move into the kitchens of modern homes many of the appliances visible there are indeed time-saving (e g the microwave oven) and do facilitate life to many busy people .
Now, I have talked a lot about time-saving and facilitating technologies because indeed I think that is what much of modern technology aims at today: to make it possible for us to save time. But then the question arises, what are we saving time for? The simple, but somewhat dejecting, answer to that question is, I think, we do not know what we are saving our time for, or rather we have forgotten why we started to save time in the first place. The next question then to demand an answer is, how does this time-saving menatality affect us? My opinion is that it has affected our way of thinking, dreaming, and imagining in quite a serious way .
I do not want to maintain that our ancestors had a more refined manner when it came to dreaming and imagining. Neither do I want to argue that modern men and women do not dream and imagine things at all. I am quite convinced that most of us nurture dreams and hopes for the future just as people always have had dreams and hopes for the future just as people always have had dreams and hopes for a better future for themselves and their children. In short, the content of our dreams and imaginations has not changed, but the manner in which we dream and imagine things have. The reason for this could be traced back to the impact of modern technology .
As I mentioned earlier, today's technology aims at saving time. But, in doing so it also makes everything go faster. And, in going faster it makes us believe that it is a good thing if we manage to get more done in the same time. This is the crucial point, because I believe that our dreaming and imagination have changed along this line so that we do not take the time to finish our trains of thought because we try to "stuff" our dreams with as much input as possible .
The problem isn't that there isn't any place for dreaming and imagination; the problem is that there are far too many places, and far too many ready dreams served us through the television and videos and far too little time to finish our dreams. Although technology has made it possible for us to save time with different kinds of machines, it has not enabled us to take the time to slow down and spend our saved-up time on finishing our dreams in our thoughts .
