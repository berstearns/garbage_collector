Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
In our world where technology is an important factor it's hard to believe that there's any place for imagination and dreaming, but in my opinion there is. Science and imagination go hand in hand and it's thanks to scientific progress that some of our dreams can come true. If we look at the things that science has accomplished to satisfy the needs of human race they are innumerable .
A long time ago when man realised that he couldn't walk on water he invented something that could float on the surface so he could cross the watercourse without getting wet. If people in those days weren't able to imagine themselves going over water staying dry they would continue to swim over. In our time era the old raft has turned into a yacht but it's still because of our imagination. If we didn't have time to dream we would have kept on crossing rivers with a raft .
The train is another example of what dreaming and imagination have provided us with. The general opinion is that speed and dreaming don't go together at all when they in fact do. It's possible to dream away even at high speed. To go by train is actually quite pleasant. You can lean back and just watch the landscape pass by and daydream. The only thing you have to worry about is what station you're getting off at. This shows that not only can technology provide means of transport but also places for us to dream in .
The ability to fly has probably been man's greatest dream ever since he was put on this earth. We have always envied the birds and their freedom to fly away wherever they want and whenever they want. For many years men and women have pondered over how to make it possible for man to fly and they succeeded. It's now feasible for us to fly, not by our own machine though, but with a little help. We can sit in an airplane and travel around the world thinking about life's mysteries at the same time. It's a great combination! There's almost never a dream that technology and science can't turn into reality. But, of course, it depends on what your dreams are and I can only talk for myself .
The fact that many people claim that there's no room for dreaming in this world has very likely derived from fear. They're afraid that technological advances will take over too much and leave them without something to do. People are afraid of feeling inadequate and no longer being needed. Dreaming is one way to get away from it all and since they can't relax they have to blame it on something, namely development. Technology doesn't keep us from dreaming, it clears the way for more and higher striving dreams .
The reason for people feeling that they don't have enough time for fantasies and imagination is all our obligations. Everyone of us has things that we have to do, whether we work or go to school. So even if we want to devote a large amount of time to imagination it's just not conceivable and it has nothing to do with our well-advanced world .
Something that has to be taken into consideration is why technology is moving so fast. It isn't something happening by itself, we are all a part of it. Our aspiration for a more convenient and carefree life is a reason for the fast-moving progress within technology. Since we're helping science on it's way to become dominating, maybe without knowing it, we can't blame it for not giving us enough time to dream away .
Another aspect to have in mind is why we feel the need for imagination? Is it because we like the idea of imagining things that can never be for real or is it to dream about things that actually can happen if we just put our minds to it? If the last reason is the most probable or common one there is no reason why technology and imagination can't be two parts of a united whole. After all, society would not be so high developed and advanced if it weren't for our imagination and striving for a better world .
