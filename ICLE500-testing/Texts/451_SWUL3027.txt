Many people claim that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialization there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Those who do, however, lack even the most basic knowledge of what our western society in fact is based upon and what it is that actually urges people to go on in their lives. It is fairly obvious that they know nothing about the close connections between people's dreams of individual success, their needs to "dream away" and scientists ability to use their imagination, and our modern high-tech society. There is no exaggeration to say that society is based upon these two factors and that without either of them it would not be as extremely advanced as it is - it would be a completely static one .
Ever since the beginning of the history of humanity the main issue has been how to find ways of surviving under the often very harsh conditions that earth exposes its inhabitants to. Today the problem has been more or less solved, however, and this is mostly due to the fact that people throughout the centuries have used their imaginative skills to develop more and more advanced tools to be used in everyday life. A side effect of this is that more time has been allotted to dreaming .
Two of the major dreams in our modern age are to be successful at work, or to become financially independent. But in order to reach these goals people must use their imagination and dreams since they are what spurs them in their stives towards their goals .
But dreaming and imagination are also useful tools to "get away" from a dreary job or the conflicts with other people that modern life often subjects us to. In these cases they work as "healers" in which exhausted human souls can find peace and which allows them to dream away to other more exiting jobs, or into a world of sympathetic fellow human beings .
Even though personal achievements form a large part of the purpose of dreaming and imagination in a modern society, they are also useful in areas where society as a whole benefits from them. Scientists can be said to belong to a category of people of which a genuine interest to satisfy other people's needs is their guiding light. But to reach success in this area a true interest in helping is not enough, a "free" mind - one that has the capability to develop entirely new trains of thought in fields that have never been explored before, is demanded. Perhaps the most significant difference between a good scientist and a genius can be said to be their personal capacity to use their imagination .
Dreaming and imagination are natural parts of the human character and people's ability to use these resources are in fact what distinguishes them from all other living creatures on earth. They in themselves are important forces which help people to go on in life, assist them in their need to escape from a sometimes too demanding reality, or participate in exploring entirely new areas of science and technology. Yet, scientists are ordinary humans with dreams of money and fame, and perhaps it is not only their wish to aid humanity which spurs them, but also the dream of making the ultimate achievement and gaining public recognition - the dream of one day being rewarded with the Nobel Prize .
