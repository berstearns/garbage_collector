Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Our world is dominated by technology. Not a day passes without us being reminded of this fact by what we see or use .
The fact that science, technology and industrialization are so dominating in our society is a threat to our future happiness. The dominance makes us feel safe, since it is we ourselves who have created it. This feeling of security is false. Progress does not only bring good fortune, however we, with our blind faith in the future, seem to be wearing blinkers .
For instance, industrialization does not always bring progress of a positive nature. Think of the workers who are being made redundant as a result of it. Having to work under the threat of being made redundant is not living a life at ease. Consequently the employees perform badly due to their uneasy existence. Thanks to science and research new projects are being launched everyday. Projects which lead to several new places of employment in the end .
You see, we are all puppets in a theatre, and whoever pulls our strings does so without thought to our mental keep. Driving to work, working in the treadmill, keeping quiet and doing as we are told, that is how we live our lives .
The scientists come up with extraordinary, new findings. However, the truth of the matter is that it is no longer a question of developping new machines for our needs, but of developping new human needs for the machines. Of course, technology has given us a lot for which we are thankful, e g air-conditioning, and other things which we do not find that necessary, e g the egg-boiler .
In the hectic society of today the room for imagination is not as large as perhaps it used to be. People can not survive without any recreation or amusement and consequently find different ways to cope. There are, I find, three different categories, as follows: 	Firstly and largest is the category of people who have to look for ways of expressing their imagination in their spare time, since their trade gives no oppurtunity during working-hours. Therefore, even if they go at it from dawn to dusk, they always find themselves some diversion in leisure hours. The negative aspect of this is that due to the shortage of spare time, some of the diversions found are not good for them, i e alcohol, drugs. To take care of these poor creatures a whole industry is created in the form of health centres and spas. At these centres the "guests" are encouraged to give a free rein to their imaginations and get to know themselves in order to submit to their fates .
Secondly, there is the category of people who need imagination to be able to perform their work, e g designers, architects, artists. Those who have creative jobs have the advantage of being able to unfold their dreams during working-hours. Consequently they do not have any imagination left when they come home after a hard days work. They get bored easily and look for diversions, which they easily find at each other's cocktail-parties. And the result of too frequent partying is a visit to a spa .
Thirdly and finally, there is the category of people who have a balanced degree of imagination divided evenly between working-hours and spare time. This is where the majority of us belongs. The people who keep the society going, pay our taxes and take care of our fellowmen of the other two categories .
To conclude, there are pros and cons with the dominance by technology as it is with so many things. I am certain we do not want to be without it. Imagination will always have its natural place in our modern world. It is only through our imagination that technology and science will find further progress .
