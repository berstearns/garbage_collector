Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Some people hold that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern society. Sadly, I must admit that I agree with them .
From my point of view, the deprivation of imagination starts already in early childhood. Parents buy ready-made and elaborate toys for their kids, instead of encouraging them to create their own. The children get used to being provided with playthings and thus gradually lose their power of initiative and inventiveness. I also believe that television can have devastating effects on children. Today a lot of kids prefer watching television to playing games or reading books. I fear that this development will deteriorate their creativity and reading ability even more .
Since efficiency and productivity are maxims of our society, there is no time and space for imagination in people's professional lifes either. A case in point is the situation of the industrial workers. Not only have they got monotonous and stressful jobs, they have also been deprived of the creative satisfaction and pleasure of manufacturing. In our society the pursuit of profit is considered far more important than creating stimulating jobs .
It is also disquieting that we have become so dependent on scientific expertise. An illuminating example is our faith in Western medicine. In former times people believed in knowledge based on experience; today everything has to be scientifically proved. Is medicine made by artificial means more reliable than Nature's own resources? I don't think the women used Thalidomide in the 60s would agree with that. As far as I am concerned, it's a con, and behind it is the pharmaceutical industry, trying to manipulate people in order to make more money. Thus a lot of innocent people are being deceived and prevented from using their own intuition and imagination when it comes to healing .
Finally, as for dreaming, some people might claim that it is not possible to deprive a person of his dreams. i venture to say that it is. Mass media and the advertising industry are constantly trying to influence and form our dreams. They decide how to dress, what to eat, how to furnish homes, where to go on vacation; they even decide what kind of friends and partners you should have and how they should look and behave in order to please you. Eventually you get so confused that your no longer know of your choices and values are your own or if they have been affected by the advertising industry .
To sum up: I don't believe there is a place for dreaming and imagination in this vacuous society of ours, and I doubt there will even be one if we don't stop submitting to this oppression of our spiritual needs. Only when we cease living up to society's expectations will we be able to fulfill ourselves .
