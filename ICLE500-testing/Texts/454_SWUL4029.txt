Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
In the beginning man was nothing more than a quarrelsome animal which had the ability to speak and think but did not exhaust himself in doing either .
Then one glorious day, one man invented the wheel and although his neighbours probably complained about his usage of the sacred symbol of the sun, he kept using his invention and one by one his neighbours became convinced of the advantages of the wheel .
Many thousand years later the first cars began to use the roads in Europe. In some countries legislation forced the driver to have a man with a red flag walk ahead of the car to warn the road-users .
Nowadays, some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But that complaint is totally irrelevant. Imagination has given us technology and science and they have in turn furnished us with time saving gadgets, fastfood, nuclear power-plants and genetically manipulated tomatoes-to name only a few inventions. These inventions have two side-effects, the first is that we have more time to dream if that is how we elect to spend the time we have saved and secondly, imagination has become more important than ever in almost every line of business .
Furthermore, technology provides us with a large portion of the stuff that dreams are made of, for example: in the film Jurassic Park technology both makes it possible for us to get an idea of how dinosaurs looked like and it also gives us the reason to believe that the resurrection of the dinosaurs really could be done, which is half the thrill of the film .
Technology can also be used to make our dreams come true by finding cures for diseases which cannot yet be cured, and many other things which we only have to conceive to realize. As a character says in Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle: [Quotation] In a wider perspective technology may be seen as our only realistic way of achieving a kind of eternal life, of course not for ourselves but for the intelligent robots we might produce in the future and thereby continuing the evolution that created us .
Unfortunately, technology does have its drawbacks, especially when it is handled carelessly as in Chernobyl or viciously as in Nagasaki, but it is not technology in itself that threaten us, it is the inherent malevolence in each of us. If there were no weapons we would be killing each other with toothpicks-if there is a will we have always had a knack of finding a way! It seems as if imagination is a bigger threat to humanity than technology is .
Still, there is the question of industrialization, a thing that frightened people at the end of the 19th century, because the machines took their jobs and often made their places of work perilous since safety routines were non-existent at that time .
However, nowadays industrialization only takes away boring and unhealthy jobs and if anyone complains about that, it is because he is in urgent need of money and not because he likes the job .
Accidentally, this brings to my mind the technocrats, who during the 30s, 40s and 50s had a persisting dream to replace bank managers, civil servants and other bureaucrats with impartial, logical and unselfish robots that would do their job swiftly and efficiently and with little cost to the tax-payers. It is a beautiful idea that certainly deserves to be tested .
