Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
In a world dominated by technology, science and industrialization some people think that there is hardly no place at all for dreaming * and imagination. They claim that technology has a checking effect on dreams and imagination. But there are from my point of view less things supporting than opposing this theory .
Technology and science has originally come from peoples' dreams and their ability to imagine things. Take for example the aeroplane. People have been dreaming of flying for centuries, and they have tried to invent wings for just as long. Finally someone invented an aeroplane. And the dream grew bigger and today we can even walk on the mon, all just because of an old dream. Most inventions, I guess, have been developed like this .
Nowadays people have everything, some people say, but if we did there would be no more inventions, and there defenately are. There are new inventions every day, big or small, and I do not think there would be if we did not dream anylonger .
Thanks to modern technology we can today share our wildest imaginations and take part of others' with the help of for example films, music-videos or pictures. A hundred years ago there was no such way of showing one another personal thoughts like that even if they wanted to. Today we can do that(with the help of for example special effects), thanks to technology and science .
Dreams are something that nothing or nobody can stop, I think. People will keep on dreaming what ever happens. There is for example an apparent piece of evidence which proves this: lottery. A lottery works well no matter what times are like. In fact there seems to be more people betting on different lotteries when times are rough than during good times. People dream of becoming millionaires; of traveling around the world; of having a new car and so on, and that has nothing to do with technology or science. We have been dreaming of the same things for ages, but nowadays there is a bigger chance of these kinds of dreams coming true. It is easier and not so expensive to travel or to get a new car today than it was for about a hundres years ago .
I have known people who are afraid that people of today, especially children, do not think enough by themselves. They think that for example video-games or computer-games are dangerous for their childrens' minds, and they think that their imagination will stop developing. Others think that these sorts of games are helping our imagination to develop There are actually no evidence at all that they are not imagining as much when they play video-games as when they play with dolls or with toy-cars .
Even though I agree with the later statement I would like to add that imagination and dreams have to be nourished, not to survive but to develop. They have to be nourished not only by watching films, reading comic-books, playing video-games or such things, but also by reading books .
