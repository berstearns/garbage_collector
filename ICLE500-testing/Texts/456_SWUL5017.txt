Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The science and technology of the 20th century have made it possible to study and explore the world we live in from the minute parts of an atom to enormous cosmic phenomena such as supernovas and black holes. This knowledge has helped us understand how the universe works and made our lives easier by preventing disease and famine in many parts of the world. Our understanding of the world has made us re-think the way we look at it. Things that were previously regarded with fear and superstition are put in a context which make them understandable and natural. But perhaps modern science has also taken away some of the magic and mystique of our world. Maybe our increasing knowledge of things has made our world a smaller and duller place to live in .
The author Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, spent a large part of his childhood during the mid 19th century in the small town of Hannibal, close to the Mississippi river. To the young Clemens the great Mississippi river represented beauty and excitement; his greatest childhood dream was to work on one of the river boats that were sailing on the Mississippi. After a series of odd jobs he managed to fulfil his dream and became a river pilot. Later in his life Samuel Clemens described this choice of career as a big mistake. No longer would the Mississippi be the romantic and exciting place of his childhood, instead he know saw it with the professional eyes of a trained river pilot. The river had been transformed from a fantasy inspiring playground to a workplace where everything had to be evaluated and measured. Maybe we all lose something when we get our romantic impressions altered by changes in our life .
Does this mean that knowledge and experiences destroy our dreams, and that we in this technological age are entering an era where there is no place for dreams and imagination; a time when everything is explained and analysed into insipid familiarity? Personally I think that if there is anything that is losing ground in today's society, it is reality .
Science has been able to explain to us the way things work, unfortunately this is not the way most of us would like it to work. We know that the world's energy resources are not inexhaustable, that faster-than-light speed is not possible and that our current way of life is destroying our planet. But knowing this has not made us less inclined to dream of things that cannot be, or imagine how thing could be if the impossible was possible. People's need to escape reality has not diminished with time, and never before have people had such a wide variety of ready-made escape routes available to them. Science and technology have provided us with designer drugs, computer games and cable TV with quintillions of channels .
Technology and scientific progress have not changed peoples need for dreams and imagination, or made it harder for them to create dreams or use their imagination. However, the form of the dreams or fantasies have changed; gnomes and trolls have been replaced by aliens and UFOs. The increasing specialisation has made it harder for laymen to understand the theories behind the scientific advances, and the scientist has become to be regarded as modern day magicians: doing things very few people understand and accomplishing amazing results The dreams and imaginations of men and women will change with the time they live in, but I am convinced that no matter what society look lik people will always make a place for dreams and imagination .
