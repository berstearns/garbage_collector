Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. One does not have to be a Marxist to understand what he meant; that religion was an escape from the hard everyday life, making people ignorant and insensible to the wrongs that existed at that time. Religion thus made it easier to control the masses - even if that was not the purpose of the rulers. Today, our society - at least in our western world - has become much more secular than in Marx's days. We could thus conclude that the masses have been liberated from their "opium"? Alas, if it were so good! The days of religious dogmas and conformity may be gone, but a new altar has emerged that has taken religion's place as an opium: television. In the four decades that has passed since the TV set first appeared, it has become an indispensable part in the daily lives of most people. Today, small children find it hard to believe that mankind had to live without television less than a generation ago - how could one live without such a "necessity" of life?
The average time spent watching television is about two hours a day, and it is augmenting. This is probably one of the reasons why the problem of overweight is increasing in our society - especially among children. The time that used to be spent outdoors playing, is now spent in front of the TV set. The time used in from of the box is, however, not primarily used for enlightenment .
When television - and before that the radio - appeared, it raised great expectations among some people. The new medium of communication was to be an excellent tool for education and enlightenment of the masses. Theatre performances, which used to be performed before only a minor part of the population, could now be broadcast into every home. Education would change, since there would be less need for the interested audience to be physically present in the same room as a lecturer - now, a lecture could be broadcast to all who were interested but who could not afford to move to a university city .
Such hopes have not been totally unfulfilled, but in general, television has become a different medium than what once was expected. Most programmes are produced to provide cheap entertainment for an audience as large as possible, thus maximising the income from advertisements. The outcome consists of soap operas, that provide an escape for the masses from the everyday life, quiz contents and - for children - cartoons. Television has become almost an addiction - like opium - that prevents people from taking own initiatives and keeps them indolent and "uneducated".
It would be rather straightforward to assume that Karl Marx, had he lived today, would have said that television is "the opium of the masses". Although television does have some good sides, those sides are not the primary use of the medium today. In our democratic society, it may not be the purpose of television to function as an "opium", but we must be aware of this side effect if we want our society to remain democratic .
