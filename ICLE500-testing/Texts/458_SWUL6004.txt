Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
How do we obtain a society with equality, not only in terms of the freedom of religion and the same legal rights for people of different colours and different sexes, but also in everyday life? I will here focus on the sex equality. There are a number of different ways to proceed in this work. One way is the feminists' way, by trying to build a wall between sexes and to accuse the men for the history. To say to a man that he as a man is responsible for all evil that men have done and do, with sexual abuse, war and violence, will not help anybody. Even if the feminists might not think that they really accuse the single man, I know men that feel accused for what other men have done, but do not feel more responsible for that than any woman. Instead, they themselves feel trapped in a role that they have not chosen, like many women feel this way. Therefore, I feel that in some respects the feminists have done harm to the cause of women, even if they by doing this have focused the problem, which of course is of importance .
Even if the feminists' way was the right to start with, to make people aware of the problem, their way is not the right anymore. I don't feel that it is leading to my goal in this question. My goal is to get mutual understanding and respect between people, independent of sex. For me, it is important not only that women get the same chance in working life, but also that men get the chance to take care of their children. In this chance is of course also a responsibility for women as well as men. Women have to take and get responsibility at work and dare to take the chance when for example offered to be promoted. This includes that the other women at the workplace support the woman that dared instead of saying that she is not good enough, because I think that there are higher demands on women than on men in the same position. It also includes that men accept women as bosses and accept to give them responsibility as well as pay them the same salary as they pay men with equal work. At the same time, men have to take more responsibility for the every day things in a household. This is a question of women letting the men take the responsibility as well as a question of the men taking it. If we respect each other as equal and try to help each other and to take responsibility in all aspects of life, I think it will do good to the cause of women as well as the cause of men .
