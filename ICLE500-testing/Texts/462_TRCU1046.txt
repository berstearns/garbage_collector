Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
If people are asked what the most important thing in life is, most of them give the same answer: money! The response to the question what their aim in life is, is somewhat different: happiness. Here, one might think, "where is here the similarity?" 
The answers are similar, in that for most people happiness depends upon money. In a way this is not very surprising, as generally happiness is received through power, comfort, pride, and popularity .
First of all, to achieve these aims a lot of people are ready to make a hard and merciless journey through life tasting the bitterness of ambition, fraud, jealousy and lies, which in this case seems very sweet to them. It is obvious that all these features have negative associations. But how can a person leave the fingers from money when you can not even make a step without it? 
Secondly, some people just want to make so much money as to stay alive. Therefore they are ready to work hard, and sometimes this readiness turns to unconsciousness. People forget their real aim in life and being unaware of it they glide in to a vicious circle without an escape...
A next issue to be taken to consideration is need. There are a lot of people in the world who do not even find a piece of bread to stop their hunger. What shall these people do if they can not find a job to work in and if the government do not have the power and organization to support them? It is a fact that these people do not think of the moral aspects of their decision. These people find an only way for solution, and this is theft! 
As a result, it can be said that the proverb "Money is the root of all devil" in the original meaning of the word is right. However, it depends on the propriety of its use .
If people are after money just because they can not get enough, and if they lose control over themselves then the devil is at work. And in most cases stopping this devil is nearly impossible. The more money is earned or "not earned", the more is wanted by people. It is just the ambiguity that awakes the devil, not the money itself. And this ambiguity is created by people, not the money. In the business to make as much money as soon as possible, people forget their real aims in their lives and suddenly they find themselves in a competition against the whole world. The will to be better than the others, to have a more luxury life, to own the most expensive things and thus to be more powerful than the others, leads people who are not able to keep their limits to deeds that are not well - seen in the society. But as long as every individual knows his or her limits and do not lose the control over his or her life, money will just serve for peoples' advantages .
