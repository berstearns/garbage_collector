Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money! For some is everything and for some is nothing. What can be done with money and what can't be done with money is always a question in mind. Can we say that money doesn't effect our life? Or can we say that every thing is based on money? Another question which is always asked is ;can money alone bring happiness? All of these are always asked and people always wonder the answer .
It is usually said that money is the root of all evil. When thought about this deeply I think everyone will agree. Can we think or a life without money? Of course no. Nothing can be done without money. If you have money you are everything. You can do anything you want and nobody can question you because you have money and you are the king. Every body bows in front of money and people can do many things for money. If you have money you are respected by everyone and have prestige in every encounter. We can see this in everyday life very obviously. When a well-dressed person enters a shop every body tries to help and respect that person. But if a very ordinary looking person enters the shop no body bothers to help unless they are asked. Another thing is if you have money and if you are ill all the doctors work for you. Nothing would be impossible. You can see the best doctors and be cured in the best way. Your children can get the best education opportunity and all doors would be wide open for you. They can go to the best colleges, have extra lessons, attend many social activities and even if they cant enter a good university they can go to private ones. You can buy everything your child wants and let him life the most comfortable life .
When looked from this perspective everything is fine but there is the other side of the story. What about the poor. Don't they have the right to live a well life. But no, if you don't have money you are nothing. You are not respected and always seen as a third class. When a poor person is ill his only opportunity is to go to state hospitals and as we know there they act as if we are animals. Why? Because you don't pay so they don't care whether you are ill or not. Every time the doctors do the same things. Just examine you a few minutes and say "you have nothing". Your children don't have the right to get a good education. Because they pay little to teachers in state schools and so the teachers don't care. Why should they work hard for so little? There are many families that can't afford to send their children to universities. They can't make life worth living for their children. Doesn't this annoy the parents. Of course they feel sad not to be able to do what their children want .
As we see the great contrast between the rich and the poor we can easily see the bad effects on money. Poor people when realize the things that can be done with money they would want to live in the same way also. And what are the ways to be rich quickly. Of course stealing or killing for money. People would rob, steal to have a better life. They may kill each other to get money. They may give their soul for money even. So very bad things can be done in order to have more money and these are evil things .
