Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
The problems have started by the use of money-which is much more practical instead of settling method. As time passed, with the developing of societies and with the increase of needs, that is, when the living conditions have got harder, money's become the root of all evils. At this position, it has gained importance how money is earned and for which purposes it is used. If a person gives harm not only to himself but also to the others and neglect social and ethic rules, it means that he earns money in wrong ways. When we think like this, money has become the reason of several evils. This is because of that money is a magical key which opens many doors. This is also because of the conditions of today. In today's conditions, they aren't nearly given any right to live like human-beings to the poor. However, people living in a society have the same basic rights such as to be educated, to be cared by hospitals and like these, money spoiled this equality and cause inequality. That is, in every stage of social life, the one who pays the piper calls the tune. People give bribe in order to be the owner of many things and to conceal their offense. If there's a need to give an example, a person who commits a traffic crime and gives bribe to conceal his crime will be a good example. This is only a small example. This kind of impropriety has taken place even in the government, which should be the most respectful institution. At the same time, people are murdering each other, they are smuggling narcotic and weapon. This means the complete ignorance of social and ethic rules. In other words, money has taken the place of humanistic values. For the sake of money, people sell their bodies, children and wives. Moreover, in order to survive, they sell their organs, such their kidneys, which has a vital role for their survival. These are organized by groups which are named as Mafia. In other words, this has become a sector .
When people aren't able to achieve the necessary conditions to survive as human beings, that is, when they aren't able to bring bread to their homes, when they can't shelter in appropriate conditions, when they couldn't send their children to the school, when they couldn't respond to his family's needs of health and when they couldn't respond to other needs of their family and most important, when they haven't got a job to achieve all these kind of needs, in societies people can be dragged to suicide. People even commit theft. I want to state that the sanction of social rules isn't important when people find themselves in these conditions .
Because of that money is an important commerce tool, it is an important element of our lives. In other words, in today's hard conditions, people venture everything in order to earn money and survive. They can easily make concession .
As I stated before, it is important how money is earned and for which purposes it is used. So, it will hinder people to suffer if it isn't used in the way of its purpose .
