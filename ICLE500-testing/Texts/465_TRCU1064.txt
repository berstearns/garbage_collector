Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
I do not have any specific information about the education system of other countries and the basic features of their universities. But it is so clear that anyone from any other country foreigner can see that the education system and most of the universties in Turkey are theorethical and do not prepare the students to the real life. It is easily understandable that the universities in our country have two main problems; Monetary problems and the other one is the education system in our country .
The first reason which do not give any right to prepare the students to the real life is sourced from the state universities in Turkey have very low aid from the government. They do not take enough money to povide real environment to the students. The monetary problem is limited the practical sides of the science. For instance; The classrooms are not decorated appropriate for using real means interested with the lesson. So, most of the time the lesson has to be passed over lightly. Absolutely, this problem is not sourced from the teachers or the students, the real responsibility is in the government's hands. Surely, the government wants to do some regulations to broaden the rights of both the teacher and the student. But they do not mention the payment that they should give the universities. Most of the time the students passed over their training period without doing extra studies interested in their field or do something for themselves for pleasure except passing the exams. It is really a big problem that the tutors only full the student's mind with mostly unnecessary things which only works with the student job, they do not add maybe can not add anything except this .
Our second problem the education system in Turkey apart from the monetary problem of the state universities, is a big problem which must be handled immediately. The system in education is very strict, it uses the student only as a model. It does not wait or want any aim from them. If you are in class and can answer the questions which directed to you at least half of the questions, you are expected to be a hardworking student. Your social life, your expectations are not mentioned and have no importance most of the time. It is really a teacher and lesson oriented system .
Although the government in Turkey has some sayings about education as "the education is our necessity like food and water" it is a real observation that it has been never ever given the real importance to the education even from the first grade to the last grade. With this perspective we can still see our second problem about the universities are theorethical because of the education system in Turkey is right. If the government do not do any payment and if the students are not rich enough to pay high taxes (in reality, in Turkey it is taken in low rate while many European countries do the opposite, they give allowance to the students) the tutors, teachers have to obey the rules and use the means that they have in their hand to enlighten their students .
In conclusion, in Turkey most of the universities are not prepare the students for real world it is so clear that all of them are theorethical. The young generation in Turkey want much more reality in their lesson and real environment. Only if the government can help the universities and provide healthier systems and regulations for education, be the universities on the right way. Parallel with this right way the enrichment of the people and the country will be in a better line much more quickly .
