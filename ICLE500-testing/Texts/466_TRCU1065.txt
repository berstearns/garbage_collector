Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Today, universities whose numbers are more than thousands all over 
the world are significant education institutions that educate people
according to profession fields. So which factors make these education
institutions so important? Maybe the first factor is that it educates human, 
the other one may e its professional education, and third one is most
probably its academic characteristics .
The quality of education of a country goes together with the 
development level of that country. If universities' goal is to prepare the
people according to their professions, their first target should be to make
these people professionally competence. Therefore; the education system
is very important . " How to supply education to the students? ", " Should 
the students be directed to the memorization? ", " Should the students deal 
with unnecessary items? Or "Should they take knowledge related with the 
real life and abstain from extras? " 
It is wrong to put all universities in the same boat. I am talking
about the most of them. Today in many universities the education is 
presented to the students theoretically. The students are rather passive
many times. They come to the class, just listen the lesson and then go .
At the end of the lesson most of the knowledge they acquired is staid on the
notebooks. However, if they were presented the lesson practically not
theoretically, the knowledge will be more permanent in their minds. They will
be willing to have that lesson again, get more pleasure of it .
In my opinion the knowledge which is learnt theoretically, is exposed 
to be forgotten and its permanence is very little value. However, I think if we 
present education in a practical way and enable their participations to the
lessons, it will be more permanent .
This example will enlighten you. Suppose that you are asked for your 
comments about a country or a city which you have not been and not seen .
But you are limited what you have already read about it. Besides suppose 
that you have been or seen that country or city and had experience of it .
In which way would your comments be effective? Can you see the 
difference? 
We can see this difference in our country ' s universities more clearly .
Many lessons in most departments are unrelated with preparing the
students to the real life. The students are surrounded many unnecessary 
knowledge. So how much of these knowledge will be acquired in their 
profession life? When will the individual apply to these unnecessary
knowledge? This is nothing more than consuming time and labor .
I have mentioned about the balance between the quality of education 
and development of a country at the beginning of my essay. Let ' s talk about 
it some more. There is no need to discuss the importance of the education in
determining the fate of the country. If you look at the improvement projects 
of the countries, you can see the innovations that will be done in the field 
of education at the top of lists. The universities whose aim is to educate 
qualified people should set up their own education policies regarding to 
these criteria. Unfortunately, this lack of the universities effects not only 
the fate of countries, but also the history of human. Have you thought 
about this problem before? 
We are in the technological era. We are making our lives easier and 
more practical by means of the innovations of the technology. So why do not
we enable this practicality in the education system? The universities' aim 
should be educating people for the sake of the development of whole world .
