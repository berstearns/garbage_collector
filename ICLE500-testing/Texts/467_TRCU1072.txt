Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
The education in university is important for many people all around the world and so many people are giving effort to take a place in university classroom. In addition to this three questions come in to our mind. Firstly, why do people want to go university? And then is the education given in universities enough? Does the universities really prepare students for the real world? I will try to answer these questions in this article .
The answer to first question is having a better job. The university degree provide people a statue and a chance to have a job wherever they want. When you apply for a good job, in a company the first question is wheather you have university degree or not. I think the reason of this is having many unemployment people and this is a good way to choose which person is more qualified. That's why you need a university degree. In contrast to this, having only degree is not a criteria . also, you should develop yourself too. When it comes to the second question which asks whether the universities' education is enough or not. Answer is both yes and no depending on department and quality of the university. Students learn everything about their department in class environment. Mostly they don't use what they have learned practically. In exams mostly theoritical questions are asked and students recite and answer .
Education is enough in regard to theoritical knowledge, on the other hand when it comes to practising they fail. Of course it isn't like that in each department of the university. For instance in Medical Department students take both theoric and practical knowledge. Especially during last two years they start to behave as a doctor. But in Engineering Department students make every projects on a paper. I didn't see an engineer candidate make a real robot or machine . If we think about teaching department practicum education is not enough. Whatever students learn important or unimportant, they have less chance to use them. They also attend practicum school but i think it is not enough. In lessons most of them can tell the course but it is different to teach young learners then advanced ones. I don't know whether there is a solution to this or not. Of course experts know better then me. As you see from the examples education in university are different in each department .
Third question looks for whether the universities prepaire students for real life. My answer is yes. Students cannot have practical knowledge. But university is a good chance for a person to grow himself and to learn how to stand on their own foot. University life have both happy times and tough times. Students may feel themself alone, bores , sort of money, crazy, strong, weak...etc. I have encountered all these situations in my university life. Moreover, students are trying to have a relationship with the people who have different characters. So that they learn hhow to tolerate people, not to trust everyone except themselves. However the most important thing is whatever you face, you learn how to stand on and how to survive .
To sum up, university is a part of our life. We have taken theorical knowledges and we have gone to school just the purpose of going but what we have gained is we have learned many things in university life without realizing. I don't agree that universities doesn't have value. In contrast, university has so much value in all over the world. Otherwise why do people spend so much effort to be able to a university student?
