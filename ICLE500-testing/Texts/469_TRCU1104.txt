Title: Capital Punishment 
 
Capital punishment is one of the most controversial topics of the world that effects the international relations of Turkey. It is a form of punishment that has gone on for many thousands of years. There are some countries that have abolished this form of punishment because they say it is inhumane, and immoral. Also religious people have fought against this sort of punishment. And some people believe the saying "blood for blood" . And some say that the people are getting what they deserve. In Turkey there are basically two groups of people. One group is abolitionists who are opposed to capital punishment and the other group is retentionists who support capital punishment .
For the abolitionists , the main reason they are opposed to the capital punishment is that because it is morally wrong and it is irrovocable. And besides, they believe that the criminal can be used for restitution to the victim's family .
In spite of all; capital punishment is a very essential issue of criminal punishment because our country does not rich enough to feed those criminals all his life and the government must protect the society from those dangerous people . And we are living in a country where there are millions of people classified as "poor" and thousands of people who are starving and in need of bread. In such a case, the government should spend the budget for feeding the poor , educating the children and by this, prevent them becoming a potential criminals for the society not waste it for feeding a hated, sinful person and even spend more money to make him/her good citizen .
From my point of view, spending the budget for improving the general wealth of the country is certainly much more prior to spending it for a criminal sentenced to life imprisonment .
Besides, there are different definitions of murder I think. Some people believe that killing anyone or anything is murder. Some of them say , murder only applies to killing humans. My definition of murder is more strict. I think murder is the killing of an innocent human being, not in the attempt of self-defense. This is important because there are many people that are against capital punishment and argue that the government is committing murder. But I say "not so", because , the person who is being executed has convicted of a big crime and he/she is no longer "an innocent human being" . Therefore the execution is not an act of murder any more .
Now let's get deeper into the issue ; If one asks what the purpose of any punishment is , the response should be to rehabilitate the individual. The reason for any punishment is to change the individual and so that they can go back into society and be beneficial for the society. Now, if someone cannot be changed , is most likely to going to be changed , then the state can lock them up for life and they would still be no threat to society. That is the argument most often used by the people against capital punishment . I would like to know , what benefits can that one person who is locked up for life can do ? ? ? And those people locked up in maximum security prisons take up over thousands of million Turkish Liras a year .
I think that price is ridiculous to spend on those that have killed others. I mean, the government does not even spend that much money on the common good citizen, how can it afford to spend that much money on those that have taken other people's right to live? 
To sum up, I should say that capital punishment is necessary for our country so that the government can spend the budget trying to feed the innocent people and educate the children and there would not be killers out there . . . . .
