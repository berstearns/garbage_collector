Title: Capital Punishment 
 
All around the world people are punished when they commit crime or do 
something illegal. There are many punishments. One them is capital 
punishment. There are many ways to kill the convicted as Hunter claims in his 
article . -There are many kinds of killing a convicted: Hanging is one. In this 
method death comes quickly. The electric chair is another way. The exact time 
of death is unknown but four to ten minutes is reasonable. Firing squed is 
the most disgusting. The gas chamber takes various minutes of misery agony 
before the convict dies. Lethal injection is another way of killing the 
convicted. When used guillotine, a french invention, death comes rapidly. As 
the last method of killing is stoning which is used in Muslim countries-. No 
human deserves to be killed by any human. Whatever s/he does s/he has right 
to live. governments may have to punish people who commit crime but the 
punishment should not be killing them. In addition to this cost of a capital 
punishment is much more then sentencing a person to life prison. Also life of 
human is given by God and it is right to be killed by God. On the other hand 
some people believe that paople should punished according to the rule "eye 
for an eye" but it is very cruel .
In every where people are given capital punishment because of their 
illegal behaviours such as murdering and adultry. However it is not a good 
solution to prevent people doing such things. This is just made because of 
man's blood lust and need for revenge. As [Reference] But killing 
someone is not a human behavior .
People live and may do illegal things through their life but it should not 
mean to lost your life because of your only one wrong behavior because we 
are human and we may make mistakes, we are not God! So all human beings 
deserve to live as [Reference] 
There may be some crimes to be punished severely, but the punishment 
shouldn't be a murder . [Reference] .
The cost of a capital punishment is higher than a life-sentence in prision 
for the government . [Reference] 
Life is a present from God to human. God gave it and God should get 
it . [Reference] 
By giving capital punishment, also the government make a negative effect on 
society as [Reference] 
Another reason not accepting capital punishment is that the person who is 
sentenced may be innocent. A person's life shouldn't be relied on a person's 
words coming from his/her mouth. In countries where capital punishment is 
used, this means that the value of their lives depends on their race and the 
jury's opinion of them .
On the other hand, some people claims to give punishment with the rule 
"eye for an eye" for the people who commit crime . [Reference] 
Every human has the right to live whatever their crime is. Giving life 
sentence in prison is a good alternative punishment instead of capital 
punishment. Also this punishment (life sentence in prison) much more cheaper 
than capital punishment for the government. In addition to these God has 
given life to human and its His right to take his life away. Nobody can 
decide another's ending. Capital punishment is very cruel and inhumane .
