Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
All human beings always find reasons for all the happenings. May be it is the easiest way to feel ourself better in negative situations. We blame money for all evils since it can give people a comfortable life. Most of the people want to get it in an easy way and they commit all kinds of crimes for the evil money. Money enables gaps between people, it leads people to commit crimes; it causes deaths, it is the reason for people's losing their human values .
Money enables gaps between people. Yes, there are really gaps between rich and poor people. Rich people are respected by all the people around them. People address them restpectfully. It does not matter whether they are good or bad. The only important point is their being rich. People do not respect to poor people. Even poor are insulted by people around them. I saw people behaving tovards people according to their wearing. This is really a stuation to pity on. We are human beings but we neglect human values because of this evil money. I belive that rich people are lack of important values. They only order. They do not think the problems of people around them. This is not valid for all rich people but for the general. This situation is the same for all the rich nations too. They do whatever they want. They win the wars. They have more opportunities in agreements after the wars .
Money leads people to commit crimes. Everyday we are reading from the newspapers or watching on television the crimes committed for money. There is nothing that human will not do for money. Some people are robbing banks without hesitating. They do not care whether they injure people working there. Some are robbing people walking on the road. There are people who are breaking into houses to steal something. They are again giving harm both the people living in those houses and the goods in that house. They are doing all tese for money. People are sometimes committing crimes for very small things such as something to eat or something to wear but these are again because of being lack of money. Everyday such crimes are getting more and more commen. Because there is an economy problem at everytime in everywhere , so people are committing crimes. There was a broadcast on TV which was wery tauchy and a stuation to think about deeply. There was a family: parents and three children. The 
youngest child was very ill. He need an operation to survive and the operation was costing too much money to this family. Father was not earning enough money to pay for this. He tried to rob a bank but he could not achieve his goal. Police caught him. After this new, a few rich people helped them and the child had the operation. Some people are committing for they really need, but some are doing this for they have endless demand for money. Drug sellers are the best example of this situation. People are making smuggling or they are selling drugs to earn money. They do not think whether the drugs they sell giving harm to the young bodies or not. They only think the money they will earn in this illegal ways. As we see from the examples the demands are also killing the human values .
Money causes lots of deaths. We are again hearing and watching the people committing suicides because of the money. People especially businessmen who go bankrupt again finding the suicide as the only solution. People who have big economical problems are trying to solve their problems in the same way. In such situations people are living a great depression. They hate living. And they hate all the people around them too. They do not want to live anymore .
Money is also the reason for people's losing their human values. Especially rich people are lack of all the nice emotions. They only order they think they can solve all the problems with their endless money. This is general idea for rich people but it is not for all the rich people. People are also behaving each other according to their richness. Rich people are more important than poor people. Rich people are more respected ones. They are luckier everytime then others. I have heard that people are deceiving eachother by seeming as a lovely friend to steal eachother's organs in order to earn money. Yes, people are so bad when the subject is money .
Consequently everybody has a demand for money. This is normal because we need it to live, but the important thing is not to lose our human values for this evil money!
