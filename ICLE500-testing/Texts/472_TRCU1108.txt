Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
With the invention of new things and the development of technology, some values like honesty, respect, kindness and friendship begin to lose their importance day by day. People give importance money than the other things . They are filled with desire and ambitious , and they become like doing everything to gain the money .
Money is the root of all evils. We will examine this under different categories. There are some people who have to do harm, for they are in a bad condition . They are indeed not bad people but as life is very difficult , it drags them into a bad situation . They do crime in order to survive. On the other hand , there are some who want more and more although they have . They are full of badness. In spite of everyting , they do not become satisfied. They can think of nothing else except money, they like it very much. It becomes their friend, in another word, it is everything for them. Money is like a breathe for them. They are excessively fond of money. There is a proverb about this situation; there is something about money that
is very alluring .
Variety of crimes like murders, robbery, theft, bribery, gambling, smuggling and prostitution are the result of money. People do these crimes to gain the money and become rich in a short time. We see and hear a lot of things on TV every time that many people kill even their relatives and friends to take their money .
I think that money causes not only crimes but also the destruction of the relationship between people. It can cause friends to lose their friendship . Nowadays, since money takes place everything , they do not care about values like friendship. If you have money , you have many many friends, you are the boss and you are the most important and valuable person in the world. For your money , they serve you with utter faithfulness and obedience; on the other hand, they can sell you even your friends .
Unemployment is the most important reason that people may do a crime. Because it drags them into a depression. As a result, they commit a suicide to go on living. Last week, while I was watching news on TV, I saw a man who was arrested because of robbery . His excuse was known; he lost his job owing to economic crises, so he had to do this. He took the responsibility for his wife and three children .
We can give Argentina as an example , too. As we know, Argentina had an economic crises last year. The most important result of economic crises in Argentina was the social deststruction. There were many crimes like plundering . People attacked to the shops and plundered the things. Furthermore , for years , money have caused the countries to lose their relationship. That one country thinks of what will benefit itself and wants to enlarge their land, causes wars, 
I will give an another example about theft. I read a news on newspaper that two men who wanted to take the bag of a pregnant woman attacked her. Also , the sister of the woman who tried to help her was attacked. The woman was taken to the hospital, because she was seriously injured. She was about to die and had to stay at the hospital for days. As her life was in danger , doctors did not let her give a birth . Otherwise, she would lose her life. I do not understand these people , how they can attack a person to take her money .
As we see , all of the bad things are the result of money. It has become our most important need like water and food. People speak most of the time about it, because everything depends on money. The one who pays the piper calls the tune. However, we do not know how to use. As we give importance money than the other things , everything becomes unbalanced. If we can balance everything and use the money properly , there will be no badness in the world .
