Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
We are living in a very big world as a human beings. There are many new things which appear every second in our life as a technology, science, math, etc . . . So we must be ready for all those conditions to adapt easily without hesitating . In this section, the universities enter and play an important role in our life for adaptation. They have got many aims but one of their most essential aim must be include to prepare quality graduates. Now, we will analize whether the universities have these approaches or not .
In our country or in abroad there are billions of universities which have got billions of students. Each person goes to university for different purposes. These aims can be to have a job, to have knowledge for the rest of their life or to earn money. Here, maybe the most important idea comes to the minds like these companies prepare their customers to the real life or not. When we ask this question to students we got many responses. Some of them said that they were given enough information for the future and the education was not only therotical . However there are some similar answers, a large number of student claimed that the education was not good to be ready for every circumstances in their coming life .
They have got some reasons to have an thought like the universities are not enough. First of all, they argue that they have not got any modern lab as a visual aids. Even though they learn theoretical information it is meaningless without doing any practice in labs or in any other conditions. Some of them also added however there are some labs but they are not equipped with the machines of their fields. Morever there are not enough seats to sit down, they can not attend to the classes . This condition is really serious for a university because the meaning of education must include every circumstances and be able to give every single knowledge to the students. So, the labs must be an important issue and donated according to the recent improvements in technology. Especially the students of Engineer Department claim that a lot of problems are waiting for them when they graduate .
When we continue to talk with students we meet with a different subject which is related again with the little value of universities. They said some unnecessary lessons make them busy, so they spend their time with meaningless subjects. According to them, these kinds of lessons are just for doing something silly. In addition to this they said when they look at the subjects in textbook they can not see any useful information which are related with their department. Also when midterm or final exams come they have to memorize all those things for nothing .
If we continue to ask the same question , maybe we will get similar or same
answers. Therefore the universities claim that they have not got enough capital, it must not be a reason. The world needs human beings who are aware of their environment and be ready for every chancing. As a conclusion we do not see defending people with the events, in contrast logical and smart people who adapt themselves to every conditions. Knowledge might not be only therotical but also practical .
