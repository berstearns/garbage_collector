Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
In all nations and education systems. universities are one of the favourite topics which are always criticized. Some says university degrees are therotical. some says not. But to say that they have totally little value in our lives will be a very faulty belief. Therefore. there are some points that explain us why they can be therotical and some points that prove us having a university degree a good helper all time. In this study . you will see all these points related to both of these sides from perspective of a university student .
When we look at its positive sides. firs of all. we see that therotical lessons must be included in evey department. It is nonsense to think that university students should only learn practical lessons. Of course. we study our lessons therotically. and the area we will practice them will be our lives. For example. in ELT Department. there are some pedegogial lessons. in which we learn about psychology. especially psychology of students. Since we will be english teachers. we will practice them in schools. If we don't have enough knowldge. what will happen in the future. in our bussiness life. So. theory means that enlarging knowledge about our own area and practice means that applying these knowledge into real life .
Another side. which prove us university degrees are not therotical. is that a peson have to know all the details of his/her job. Again for our department. only knowing the language is not enough itself. We have to know literature and cultue of the country that we teach its language. Practicing these in our lessons will be very benefical during our teaching life after the university .
Also. there is one more positive aspect of having univesity degree. Universities are a good chance to enrich our knowledge about life. A person graduates from univesity with a lot of expeinces; not only about his/her profession. but also about people and social life. In our country. a freshman comes to school about 18-20 years old so this is the first step of him to real life. He experiences living far away from his family. He learns how to struggle against life on his own. He meets a lot of people and lives a lot of thing with them. He transfer new information from them to his own pesent life and keep some of them to use in his future life. Because of all these reasons. it will be wrong to think that having university degree has little value. and doesn't prepare us to real life .
On the other hand. if some conditions musn't be provided. university degrees become therotical. First condition is that. lessons given in universities have to be suitable to the nation's characteristics. in which univesity is settled down. For instence. in our department. we have Material Development lesson. In this lesson. we learn preparing materials suitable for classes contain 20 or 30 student. In contrast. in Turkey it is almost impossible to have classrooms in this number so we will never use information that we learn in this lesson .
Second condition is that . some departments need some equepments. If goverment doesn't provide them these tools. teching university becomes therotical. For example. Could it be thought that a computer engineering department without computers? What will do they in the lessons? Only they get some infomation from their books and unfortunately. since they don't know how to use information. they will fail in real life. And people among them think that going to university useless. university graduates don't know any thing .
Thirdly. a university has to change itself accoding to time. While eveything is changing and new things are being invented. for a university staying at the same point with same information will be a big demolition for its students. If a student gain new things from shool. it will be easier for him to practice them in real life. But if university give him infomation from his big . big grandparents' time . it will be end both university and student. Because he got therotical knowledge from university which he never use. And again university become therotical and its degree will have little value in student's life .
As a conclusion. universities are not valueless institutions that never prepare their graduates for real life. It is us that make universities therotical. When we - nation and goverment-give enough importance toour universities . we will have sophisticated university graduates who have enough knowledge about their job and life .
