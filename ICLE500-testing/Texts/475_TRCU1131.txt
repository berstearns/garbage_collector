Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
I agree with the statement that most university degrees are theoretical and don't prepare students for the real word and therefore they are of little value. However, this never means that university education is not so useful and important. Conversely, it is necessary and it is the base step for the real world since it supplies students with jobs in their future life. However, because of some reasons the value of most university degrees decreases .
First reason is that most universities give importance to only theoretical information. They don't pay attention to practice. Although they are both necessary in a sufficient and efficient education and they are a unit together, they only supply the students with the theoretical part of what they need. However, in such a system the students are led to memorize and especially in the exams they do so only to pass the class. But, such a system never works. Because, theoretical information is easily forgotten after a time when it is not turned into practice. That time, the student are deprived of both practice and theoretical information. So, many lessons they have taken become meaningless and therefore university degrees become of little value since they don't reach the aim of preparing students for the real world .
Second reason is that some universities provide a chance for students to practice what they have learned, but I think they are not valid. Because the students practice in nor real conditions. As an example, I can give the teaching practice made in education department. Because the students make a role-play while practicing. I mean, instead of real students who will learn the subject, they practice with their friends. Therefore, they don't meet a real problem that they can face in real conditions. They don't have a chance to see their weak and strong sides in teaching. Everything seems all right although in real conditions it may not. Besides the materials they use in teaching may not be available in their teaching and so they may be obliged to tell a lesson without some materials. Therefore they can have some difficulties. Expect these practices made in classroom, the students also go to training to the schools. However, I don't think they are enough. Because they go to training only one 
time a week in their second year of education and they only observe what the teacher does. They get a chance to tell a lesson in real conditions only in their fourth year, but they don't teach everytime they go to training. It is sometimes and I think it is not enough for the students to be well-prepared for their real teaching .
One more reason of most university degrees being of little value is due to some students and teachers. I think, many of them don't pay enough importance to education. For example, the students don't attend the lessons regularly. They either don't do their homeworks or copy it from their friends. They memorize the theoretical information given to them only to pass the class, instead of learning them and after a time they for get many of them. Besides they can also cheat in the exams. So, all of these things decrease the value of university degrees. On the other hand, some teachers don't make their responsibilities properly. Some may not come to lessons regularly and some only come, tell the lesson and go. They don't make the students to learn better. So, the teachers may also cause the value of university degrees to decrease .
To sum up, most university degrees don't prepare students for the real world because of some reasons. They don't give a chance to students to practice what they have learned theoretically. Although some of them provide such a chance, sometimes it may not valid and enough. The teachers and students themselves, also can cause the university degrees to be of little value. Therefore, the universities should make students to practice properly to be well-prepared for the real world and the students give very much importance to their education since they are responsible of their own life. The teachers should also help them as much as possible .
