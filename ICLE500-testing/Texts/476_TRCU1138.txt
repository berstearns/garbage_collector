Title: Capital Punishment 
 
For centuries, capital punishment has been performed all over the world in order to punish criminals. Capital punishment is a legal infliction of death as a penalty. In fact, the death penalty is the most controversial penal practice in the modern world . Whereas some of them object to this punishment, some support it. The some death penalty methods mainly used today are hanging , the electric chair, firing squad, the gas chamber, lethal injection, guillotine and stoning. For some people, capital punishment is necessary, because it is a way to provide peace in society. Unlike them, many people against to this cruel form of punishment because of several reasons .
First of all, everyone has the right to live and everyone should respect to this fact. There are many people around and they have different characters and behaviours. Although it is natural and necessary to punish the illegal behaviours for peace of society, nobody deserves to kill because of his/her behaviours. The punishment of murder shouldn't be killing, for example. It is not right the extermination of human beings in the name of justice. The government should find another way instead of death penalty such as sentencing someone in prison. Life is a present to us from God and only God should take it away from us .
Secondly, the methods of capital punishment are so cruel and they are not accepted as humane. In 1977 Oklahoma became the first U. S. state to authorize execution by lethal injection. Lethal injection is when a lethal gas is place into the convict strapped down to the table. In addition, there is recent news; a woman who has been punished by stoning in Iran, because she has a baby without getting married. This kind of penalty is cruel and inhumane and also it is contrary to Islam. Furthermore, if you watch "Green Mile" on cinema, you can see its brutality. There is a man punished by death penalty and he is strapped into electric chair and electric current is passed through his body. It is really inhumane .
Finally, there is a question comes to our minds. Is capital punishment really effective? Does this death penalty really prevent the crime in society? In fact, it doesn't work because the rate of crime is increasing day by day. Death penalty is not a prevention for criminals. For many criminals, being killed is better than sentencing the rest of their lives in prison .
As a conclusion, people who commit crime should certainly be punished in order to prevent crime in society and it is also necessary for peace of society. But capital punishment is not an acceptable because of the reasons written above. Meanly, Everyone deserves to live and nobody, including government, decides on someone's life. Capital punishment does not really prevent the crime. It is the another reason of opponents of capital punishment. Finally, because the death penalty is a cruel form of punishment, it should be abolished in the world. Today 80 notions have abolished the death penalty and they use imprisonment instead of it .
