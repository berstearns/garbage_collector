Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
I am a third class student in ELT department and when I ask my self about the quality of the education that I have been taking , I realize that it is mostly full of theoretical information and university education does not prepare me for real conditions. In an other word university education does not provide me with the necessary experiences for teaching satisfactorily in the future. This situation decreases the value and importance of university education in my mind. So in some aspects I agree with the idea that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for real world. They are there for of little value. The main reason for thinking so is poorly designed lesson plans of universities .
The chief reason decreasing the value of university education is insufficient lesson plans. I think being a good teacher has some important components such as knowing your subject very well , knowing how to teach it to the students , being able to sympathize with students , being able solve different problems etc . . . Sometimes I ask that how many of these features we will have when we graduate from the university as English teachers. As first I think of our subject , namely English. It could be possible to accept that at university we learn English in a sufficient way. In an other word we have the first feature , adequate knowledge of our subject , of a good teacher. But when we ask about the other components of the ideal teacher it impossible to say that we gain those features during our university education , because lessons such as teaching methods and education psychology taught at universities are designed in a poor way , and so these lessons can not go further than providing 
students with theoretical information. They are just theoretical because , these classes are designed just for the ideal situation , for situation that is supposed to be , but not for the real situation .
For example; in method classes we are taught a set of teaching method. We study what these methods aim , what kind of activities they consist of , but we do not cover what kind of problems we will have while using these methods. Moreover we do not have the practicing these methods in real situations. In order to practice these methods we have some micro teaching experiences. But these micro sessions are so far from real conditions that we get nearly any profit of them. In this sessions our objects are our classmates so the level is very high and we do not have any problem while experiencing the methods. Every thing goes in a perfect way so we are not able to learn what kind problems we will face while using these methods , what kind of questions we will be asked , in which part of the subject students will have difficulty to understand etc . . . . Since we do not have any problem in micro sessions , we do not know what to do when students come up with an unexpected question , how to answer it. When I start to teach in a school and when I face many unpredictable questions , reactions etc . . , since at the university I am not prepared such kind of situations we will have to produce our own method and we will keep the methods that we study at university just as inadequate information .
An other example of poorly designed lessons is education psychology classes. These classes aim to teach us sympathizing with our students , understanding their psychology, feeling etc . . . In these classes the general image of our object , namely the image of our students is thought as the perfect children who are eager to learn whatever we telling. But in real situation we will deal with many different personalities and it certain that all of them won't be wonderful children. We will have problems with our students and we are not given any advice about what we should do when one of our students breaks the concentration of whole class in an unacceptable way or how we should react when a student reject to listen to the lesson , etc . . . Shortly education psychology classes just provides us with insufficient information 
As conclusion I can say that as a result of poorly designed lesson plans of universities , we will graduate from university as insufficient English teachers. When we face a problem with our students , our inadequate method an psychology classes won't be able to help us and at this point we will try to remember what our primary or secondary school teachers used to do to solve problems or to teach a subject etc . . . In an other word we will probably be a apprentices of our ex-teachers rather than university graduated teachers as result of theoretical lesson plans of universities .
