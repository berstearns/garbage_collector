Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real life is a common lament of students which exactly represents human beings desire to find everything has been prepared by someone else for them to take the pleasure of. When it comes to the argument on the value of the university degrees , to make the value judgement we should make clear the answers of the following questions: What is it we name real life? What is main task of university education? And as the last question, what is the task of the student during the university education?
The term which we referred to as real life defines a complex structure within which a person may get into contact with different people with differing expectations and point of views. This variation in exectations and point of views causes various problems to come to the surface. Then if we want to find a solution to the above complaint about the universities inadequacy we need a university which gives the students a list of the possible human expectations and point of views. Furthermar, it should also be included in the list that which expectation and point of view brings about what sort of problem. Still, it is not enough. The solutions to verying problems should also be listed with a simple easily comprehensible style. That is not it! Such a thing can not even be called as utopia. Then what should be the contribution of university education to a student?
The surface responsibility of an university schedule is to supply the students with the theoretical knowledge of their department. This is the most visible but the least important task of a university education. The others, making the students gain critical thinking and problem solving abilities are the least visible but the most vital mission of university education. Students should be expased to as many different point of views about as many subjects as possible. Other than imposing certain truths the system should let the students to realize and criticise different views and construct their own point of views. The tendency of accepting all the things written on a piece of paper as changing truths should be demolished. If a person gains the ability of critical thinking then she becomes able to see the gaps not only in the point of views at other people but also in her own way of looking at life. Realizing the gaps and criticising meself brings together the change and development. A person who can develope oneself becomes a fully functraining person for the society and it beers at the same time personal satisfaction and happiness .
Additionaly, education in a university should not be taken as exposing students to a mass of knowledge to memorize. Students should not be lacked at the affective domain, they should be given the chance to apply what they be expanted to cognitive domain. This brings together the maturation of education process the role of the students also very big .
The first responsibility of a student is to determine the exact purpose of her university education. She should be able to apply her knowledge into her life and should be open to new ideas and should work really hard. She should also understand that nothing beautiful comes as ready in a big ornamented package in the real life. If one wants something she should give time and enough effort .
As a conclusion, the thing which we call "real life" is something really difficult to cape with to learn how to come over it no university programe, even the best one, is efficient enough on its own. The cooperation of the education system with students results in qualifed and skilfull students to graduate from university departments and any problem that they will come face to face in reality seems them as impossible to be solved because they would be skilfull enough to find alternative solutions to problems even the ones that seems to be impossible to come over, then the university degree becomes the most valuable thing to passess on the earth .
