Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Today more and more people from young generation are struggling in a competition in order to win the university entrance exam. Since it is their most challenging and desirable target to become a university student. When they reach their goal and begin to attend it, they see that being there is not the end of the competition. Exams continue till the graduation, till the most basic aim-getting the degree. Although youth expect a great many things such as a good future, a good life and a good career from their degree, most of the time a degree means nothing. Due to the fact that taking a degree does not mean anyone is ready for the real difficult life which gives so many responsibilities or anyone has developed appropriate character to start the new life or anyone is qualified enough to get, deserve a job in my opinion there are a few main reasons that result in these realities I have mentioned above. Firstly, most of the university students study only for passing the exams. Secondly, generally except from private universities, universities are lack of many facilities. Lastly, students do not make any effort to improve their knowledge, skills or any hobbies to add something new into their personality. These are the basic causes I will mention about which decrease the value of the degrees according to me .
To begin with we can talk about the students' studying habits. Mostly their only aim is to pass the exams. Therefore, there is no regular studying style, on the contrary, there is last night studying till the morning. What can be expected from such a studying? Because of this type of studying everything is being memorised which can be forgotten in a short time or even during the examinations namely, the knowledge of studied field is useless and futile. Students do not contribute information about their field so much to themselves .
Next, qualities are not qualified enough for the students to have an opportunity to improve themselves. Even some universities are made up of only one, two or three buildings, nothing more. Yet a good university should have a large campus which consist of illuminated libraries, laboratories, searching centers with computers and leisure centers that enable students to develop themselves. There should not be time for them to stand lazily. In contrast time should be worthy and the students should evaluate their time with beneficial interests .
Finally, students are effortless. They do not struggle with difficulties. Even though universities aren't well qualified individuals especially young individuals can achieve everything with their ambitions. Only if they can add new knowledge to their existing knowledge by making much research, new skills to their existing skills, new hobbies to existing hobbies they are well educated. All I count require curiosity. University students should be curious about all new things, but not about unnecessary things .
As a conclusion, if a graduate wants his/her degree to carry importance or real valve, he/she should have made so many efforts to deserve it. Otherwise it cannot be something other than a blank sheet .
