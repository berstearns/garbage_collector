Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
I don't agree with the above topic because criminals do what ever they do intentionaly now why should they be taken to rehabilitation; some people have to endure the pain that they cause so they have to suffer also so that they learn what they did was wrong .
Like in our community if you go to the Kimberley General Hospital on weekends you will see that there are too much cases of assult; too much stabbing and not forgetting rape; so how can we forgive an forget so easily; when you commit a crime you have two choices eather you do that or you don't do it; they are some criminal who will say I did not have a choice I was hungry or I needed the money there is not such a thing; there are people whom don't work or are not employed but they make means of making money. God have given everyone a brain so you can think for yourself what you can do best and set your through and energy on that so that you can achieve that goal .
For example in the morning news a man have chop her mother and niece with an axe it was brutally now we the community have to let it go and take that man to rehab; that man is not sick what if that man goes free again because he was not sick he knew what he was doing and goes on to have more innocent lives on the list; these criminals have to face the consequences and go to jail not rehabilitation .
Criminals have to go to jail and when they are there they have to face hardship so that when they came out of jail they should have repend and know that they are previous live was a sin; most criminals came out repend so they can make right for the wrong doings they did; In some case criminals don't think what they did was wrong so they go on doing crime now for those criminals they do things intentionally and are proud of it .
Like last year the Goverment let all the under age criminals out of jail saying the jails are full which was wrong because those criminal are back to the street again and are doing what they did but only this time they are doing more crime than before; they are saying that they are now man enought; the Goverment should have build more jail these is a serious problem the Goverment is using money for other things which we the community don't benefit from it they should use money for important things .
Now what if the rehabilitation also get full where are they going to take those criminals set them free again no it's wrong very wrong; Let them go to jail and face what they did .
