Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Personally I partly agree with the above statement when it says "the prison system is outdated. The way the police treat prisoners is uncalledfull. The initial establishment of this institutions, I believe was to correct these people, that is why it is called correctional services. Hence they seem to be ignoring the fact that these people (prisoners) are supposed to get out of prison, and go back to the society .
If the constitution of the country would be revisited again; the courts law or decisions be amended, maybe it would serve the purpose and accomodates, satisfy every involved party. After the judgement of the court, The magistrates together with the prison wardens must sit down and agree upon the treatment of prisoners. They must treat them equally, they must not look at which criminal offence did the person commit. Because they appear to be overlooking matters and personalising things. More that correctional services does not have the vivid information pertaining cases they only appear in picture after the person is already sentenced .
Apparently what is happening in prisons its devastating, its making matters worse. The prisoners feel they are being isolated. But they must be given reasons as to why, them specificly are placed where they are. They must be given a reason to understand, to want to see themselves again as members of the society .
Conditions within the prison cells are really harzadous, they must be impoved. Even amongst them (prisoners) its not good, they jeopardise each other's lives. Should they be given reasons to treat each other decently, there would not be killings in prison. The thing is these people lack information, they do not have hope, they need to be assured of the good things that they will be able to do when they come out of those prison doors .
The reason why I say the constitution should be revisited is that, Immediately when a person is sentenced or have a criminal case, automatically in the eyes of our country is labelled a criminal. This person cannot be granted a permission to work anywhere even if his or her qualifications allows him. Meaning is not being taken there to be rehabilitated but to be punished. That thing affects the entire life, because every single application form that you fill asks if you have any criminal case. Automatically you are not given a reason to behave well in prison, you have already lost confidence in yourself. More especially when you are sentenced for many years .
To have a criminal case it is not what you choose deliberately. It might be a conspiracy by your enemies. People should not be judged by the criminal cases that they have, rather be judged by their behaviours or the way they conduct themselves, inside and outside prison. Though there are those prisoners who a willing to change, but being influenced by others to be who they are not .
However the society plays the biggest role in determining who these people really are, after leaving prison. The society distance itself from these people, they see them as criminals, without evaluating if these person changed. Even family members they isolate you, when you are sentenced automatically they forget all about, take you out of family plans. This is really immoral its unethical. It is against the norms and value of the society, there suppose to be unity amongst people no matter what .
In some instances they cannot even be given food, they now resort back to bad things like stealing. What lead to this? The way the society Perceives them. Sometimes they even decide to make prison their homes because they are not welcomed at home. They do not see the neccesity of belonging somewhere. Sometimes even if they are at prison family members and friend do not pay them visits .
If maybe the legislature, Correctional services and the society can emerge and implement an organisation which will deal with problems and matters relating to these conditons it will serve a purpose, not excluding prisoners from this alliance, so that they can raise their concerns and grievances. Together we can make or build a better nation .
