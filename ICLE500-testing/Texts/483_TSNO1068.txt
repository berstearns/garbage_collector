Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
The prison system is troubling our sisters and brothers. Just think of the darkness and the treatment at the prison. The police themselves are likery to change their attitudes towards these people. They make them their slaves by washing their clothes and these Prisoners have to make sure that these prisoners do their job well before they gave them something. I would say the prison system make these people feel that they are not human beings, part of them belongs to animals now that they are treated like animals .
For example the treatment that they receive at the prison some of them end up commiting suicide. Their minds began to change, others end up being mad asking themselves where did everything went wrong, why did She/He did that?. Other lost trust in themselves, like asking themselves how will the society take me, my family and my friends will they believe me when i say i don't know how it happened .
Prison system makes people worse, your mind function faster. You fail to believe that there is an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it .
As a result i think Society should not punish the criminals but rehabitate them. Rehabilitation is the best because You will meet professionals who knows better about human beings .
Some of them know why people behave the way they do, some of them know people think the way the do and others know why people feel the way they do .
When that person who has done something wrong enter there one of the professional (Psychologist) should ask that person to tell the truth if he/she want to get help. That person must answer Questions that the Psychologist is going to ask. Possible Questions will be why did you do that, what came into your mind, Did you know the effects of doing that? What do you want us to do? What are you going to do when you get the remedy .
Those psychologists i think they are going to make sure that the patient is cured and they will decide when to release the patient .
Finally to add on the issue of rehabilitating the peoples the psychologists there or Psychiatrists are the ones dealing with human behaviour, human emotions human mind they know better on how to deal with the person concerned .
