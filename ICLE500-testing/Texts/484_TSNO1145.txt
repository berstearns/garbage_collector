Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
To start with, for something to happen; there must have been a cause, like wise, for prison system to be established, there were a considerable number of factors which were mushrooming, therefore the following are some of such factors; theft, rape, tribalism, Poverty and many more others, not mentioned .
Firstly if I was cought in the act of stealing, the first thing and the best thing that the low think of is imprisonment, whereas precoution measures should have been applied, For example. I Should be asked where I come from, why I diceded to do that, and if possible be taken home so as to analyse why I came to steal. Maybe I stole becase I wanted to feed my family. If its from that angle, then I Should not be taken to prison, insted I should be given a task or work, even if I'm not educated so that I will be able to feed my poor family. If I'm doing it out of gratitude then I must be taken to prison on harsh. Conditions and if posibble one hand should be Cut off because its the one that does the stealing, if I Continue, one leg should be taken off becase its the one that does the walking. Secondly people who rape should be counselled and maybe tought with literal examples of the damage they have done on somebody, if this is to no avail, well I suggest no imprisonment, what I think should be done is cashation for both male and females to end this unclean behavior .
However this are just Ideas, but Can be of help if taken into Consideration. In Iraque I herd such punishment are used; and Rumour continues that in that Country even if you walk alone at any hour of the night, you will have peace around you; get me right, I m not saying there is no crime in that country, but minor crime is strictly dealt with, that people being packed into prison camps for little crimes .
Lastly trabalism is also a contributary factor, in that, in one Country there are two tribes with different belives, Culture, and history, and when it comes to power, however, one tribe is not fully representd, this leads to that tribe in power, electing only its own people to power on the contrary to the other one, this result in fighting, gansterish and more people being taken to prison, Some for the crimes they did not comit, but just because they belong to the minority tribe. thus prison camps are wrongly used. The fact that the prison systeams are outdated, moreover they are old and not habitable, for instance, you find that a cell or a room is in one place with a toilet, how does one eat or even sleep with a smell of stench all around him. Moreover how do fife people sleep in a cell meant for one. you will find that we are trying to solve a problem with a problem, because in those cells prosioners develop bad behaviours like a male having sex with a male, and this result in incouraging diseases like H.I.V aids and other sextually transmitted diseaseses .
