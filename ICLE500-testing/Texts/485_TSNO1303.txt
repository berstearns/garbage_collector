Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Society should not punish its criminals because when they take the law into their hands by Punishing their criminals they end up killing them. These criminals must answer for that bad things that do within the society .
If someone did wrong we must take him/her to the Police station and the court will - see whether this crimal is the one that cause the crime. If there is a lack of evidence then that crimals will set free. Some people do crime because they are short tempered. For an example a husband and wife maybe a wife can do many mistakes that her husband did'nt like it, and the husband keep on warning her. At the end he kill her. That husband he must not taken to court. He must be taken to People who will help him. Members of his family should comfort him/her. He/she must be taken to the psychologist/social workers, so that they can talk to him/her and he/she will saw his/her mistakes rather than taken to court .
When she/he will taken to court he/she will be out of bail. Then the society will Punish him/he for his/her wrongs. We should talk to him show him/her wrongs. Then I think at the end she/he ask for mercy because he/she will saw that he/she had done wrongs .
Look at the case of Mamokgethi Malebane of Katlehong Location of Gauteng Province. Someone came to fetch her at school and then he rape her. After weeks the society knows that he is the one who raped the child. Then he lives with fear. He knows that he is going to be killed at anytime .
Then he was at Prison for almost a month then out of bail. Then society did not like that thing because the child suffers some injuries the time he rapes her. For him to Protect himself One day he goes to school where child is a learner and taken her to the bush raped her again and kill her. But at the end society knows that he is the one who is responsible for the child's death .
I think that the first time when that man rape this child, he must be taken to the Psychologist so that he can speak out his problems. I think that if it was so the child will be still alive this time. We the society we must not rush into things. Let the law and Psychologists do their work. If we take crimals to the Psychologists they will try to show him/her that he/she had done wrong and show him the rights and wrongs then I thought he will came back to the society. He will be the right person again .
Many deaths occurs because we the society we do not rehabilitate that criminals instat we want to take the law into our hands .
I thought if we can Proceed on rehabilitating criminals high rate of crime will be less. No One will be afraid of one another. We can go whatever we want to at anytime. Nowerdays we live with fear. I am afraid to walk there at Mafikeng town carrying my wallet on my hands because everybody looks on it. Because if they saw it they will ask you to give it to them or they will kill you .
So I thought rehabilitation will decrease the crime and death rate. Society should not Punish its criminals let's try to talk to them. Let us show them the right way. To Punish them will not solve anything. They will keep on doing the wrongs. If you know someone with high criminal rate Please took her/her to the people who will help him/her. Don't just leave them that's why they carry on doing the same thing .
