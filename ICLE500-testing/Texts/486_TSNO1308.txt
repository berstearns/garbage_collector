Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them
 
Society should not punish the criminals but try to motivate them or to bring them to their normal lives. No one is allowed to be punished, but to advised about what she/he was doing. This can be solved by inviting psychologists to give them free lessons about their behavior and also the society should be invited to tell them about how they behave in their community. As an individual, you can avoid yourself in many things for an example to be a criminal, youth group and sports should be formed .
Is a responsibility of the society to motivate the criminals, not to bring them to prison because they are human beings just like anybody. They have their needs in life, they are normal. The society should councel them about how are they doing to be in future. This, can affect them in their mentality. They can be given life sentence if they don't behave well for example if the society tell you about the advantages and disavantages of what you have being all along then you don't take them into consideration, is then that you are judged for a life sentence .
The psychologist should also invited to councel them about what is going to happen in future .
If you are a criminal, there are some forces that forced you do that, for example if you see a beautiful car, you will steal it for the purpose of money, simply means you are under pressure. They are various ways of getting money not to put yourself in danger. You can go to school and become educated and finally you can get a job .
Youth groups should be build by the society so that many people could take part. There must be some dramas or music so that they can keep theirselves busy. The aim of this youth groups is to avoid people to misbehave .
Also the society should build sports. The sports offices should be there to help people in sport activities e.g. soccer, netball, tennis, high jump etc. People should take part on this activities to keep themself healthy and strongly, because their muscle are working every day .
As a person or an individual, you have to avoid yourself in doing wrong thing. The society can call psychologist, youth groups and sports can be formed but if you don't want to change your bad attitude to people, there is nothing we can do. A person should chancge by his or her own mistakes .
