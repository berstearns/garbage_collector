Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
The notion of prisoner rehabilitation implies that the inmate needs to be changed. From this notion, it follows that the prison is an ideal place for this change to take place. It is assumed that intensive techniques that will reconstitute the offender so he will live "responsibly" in the freeworld can be imposed on the inmate in a highly structured situation. Such notion are not illogical if one believes there is specific factors that can be administered to bring about REHABILITATION. And it is helpful if one ignores basic inconstencies in the environment in which these programs are to be instituted in an environment of fear, aggresion, totalitarianism and exploitation
Therefore, the society should not punish their criminals but rehabilitate them, because imprisonment is a waste of money. The government uses a lot of money building prisons and employing people who work in prisons. For example, in South Africa, over 3000 people are being trained to work with crime. Futhermore, the government is trying to ensure that there is no overcrowding in prison, which means it has to deal with money. In Empangeni, Qalakabusha Prison has been made bigger and the government is planning to increase also the size of Kokstad Closed Maximum and Devon Pre-Release centre near Springs .
Similarly, prisoners are bought food and clothes. In Botswana prisoners are well fed and more money is being spent also in their medical expenses. Moreover, they are bought soccer kits as their teams are in super league. In addition, their shelters are being comforted by nice beds and the houses they live in are electrified. The money the government spent in prisons could have been used in charity societies to assist disadvantaged people like old people, blinds, crippled people and orphans .
Furthermore, people's dreams are being defered. In other ways, talented people are denied the opportunity to expose their talents. For example, musicians like Mzwakhe Mbuli is now imprisoned and he is no longer singing. This is a waste of people's talents .
Prisons system exploits people in which they are separated from their families and friends .
Children miss their parents and they are being expelled from schools and they do not have anyone to pay their school fees. Some children leave school because they do not have good parental advice. Moreover, they do not have anyone to tell them how good education is .
Similarly, if we take Zimbabwe's land reform, innocent people are being arrested because they failed to heed deadline to leave their farms. The government could have asked farmers to share their land with poor people not to take it by force. All These lead from the goverment who stepped its efforts to seize white-owned land as it rounded up more farmers defying eviction notices .
In conclusion, I urged that criminals should be rehabilitated to avoid waste of money by the government in criminal premises. An after rehabilitation criminals should ignore basic inconsistancies in the environment as it has been suggested earlier. This, as I think will decrease poverty and the country developments will not be affected as such .
Prison people are also our problem because they affect our progresses. As people we have to think about prisoners as being criminals or decrease crime rather than labelling them by name of criminals. Words like murderers and thieves should not be used as they are offensive, negative labels that demean and devalue the person as a whole .
