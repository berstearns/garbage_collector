Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Our prison system is an ideal place for killers, rapers and all those other monsters, instead of being a refuge for them, thus helping them to change their wicked ways. For their own good and our peace of minds, criminals should be converted into better human beings than be made into the worst and indecent human beings .
Going to prison, for most criminals, has become the best way of acquiring skills to help them be better at their deeds, when come out. Some of them commit crimes when they come out of prison because, they had been used indecently in their cells, by their in-mates or even the prison wardens. They had either been raped, burnt, or even beaten up, so they become rebellious. Others learn bad habits in prison, like smoking dagga, stealing, killing people or selling drugs. Thabo, an ex-convict, is now a thief, a gang-master and a drug dealer because that is what he learnt from prison . "The warden, Thembela, who was my buddy, used to sell drugs to us and I learnt from him, the channels and ways of acquiring them". This clearly indicates that our prisons are higher institutions for criminals .
Futhermore, James, another ex-convict who sells second hand cars, said he got his skills of hijacking cars and completely covering his tracks from a police friend, who gets thirty-five percent of the profit . "Morake has taught me well, now I can even do it without holding a gun and you would never know what hit you, then I just relax and enjoy myself with a prostitute", he boasted. Seeing the look of disgust on my face, he adds wickedly, "When the money is real good, I prefer a threesome". Despite the fact that AIDS messages are being preached everyday, he seemed not to care. As if that was not enough, he told me that the reason why he is never worried is because the victims run away without taking a good look at him or they are "never there to pull shit on me!", meaning that he kills them .
In addition to that, he said "if it's a man or an ugly woman, I kill them before they know or realise what's happening, but if it's a beautiful woman, I have a taste of that forbidden fruit first and when I've had enough, he has to die, I don't have any choice". He says that with a shrug of the shoulder as if it doesn't matter. The way he explained the whole thing to me, without even feeling guilty almost made me want to vomit. Prison has robbed criminals of their consciousness, they don't even have feelings anymore. Hurting other people or killing them is just playing soccer or playing chess to those criminals. To them, it is just normal .
One would actually ask-questions like; "If our prisons are like that, where are we headed as a society?" "When is it all going to stop, if we are making the situation bad instead of correcting it?" "Don't we think that instead of punishing those criminals, we must rathe rehabilitate them?" According to reseachers, punishing them, only makes them more rebellious, but correcting them by giving them some form of education and counselling may help them to be better members of the society. They should be taught how to earn a decent living out of the little that they have. For example, they could be taught to make hand crafted objects, or plant crops and sell them for a profit .
Lastly, I would say that not all prisoners are criminals, so, the society must not treat them like outcasts because, instead of making them it would break them. Just like new born babies, they need nurturing. They also need to know that we do care and they are our fellow human beings, our brothers, our sisters, not monsters to hate and be afraid of .
