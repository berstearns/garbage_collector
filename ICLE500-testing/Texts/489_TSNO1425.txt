Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
This is quite a dodgy issue. First of all we need to understand the initial intention of feminist before concluding wether they have succeeded in their mission or not. Again we need to examine wether these feminists we males of females. It is no argument that the majority of feminists are women which gives rise to the following question:"why?"
To answer that we begin by defining feminism in lame man's terms: "It is the kind of process or action that primarily concentrates promoting women issues, their rights as human, their desire to be recognised and respected, to be considered and accomodated in their society." NOW for the fact that there is a need for women to be recognised, it clearly indicates that there is a lack of such. This then ushers us into examining why there is a lack of recognition for women in our societies .
If memory serves me correct, the plight of women is only but one of the most recent occurances. You should remember that it is only a couple of years ago, when South African women went to some women Empowerment conference in Beijin (sp). That caused a lot of noise, suddenly the nation leaders and civilians were flushed with mixed emotion. Some felt demascubted, some proud of the fairer species taking their stand in the global society. And then there was a commercial craze over the matter, the music industry cashed in on it. American, South African and other European music writers and produces came up with groups Like Spice Girls, Destiny's Child and the likes .
With songs like "scrub", "Independent Women" ' men now really started to feel intimidated. It was the very industry that first started with the retaliation, a coolision led by male musicians against the women generation. I am sure u can still remember the song "scrub" and Mandoza's hit single "50/50".
From that point, the snowball began. There is nothing more dangerous than a man who feels like less of a man. Women were in parliament, the government is on the women's side, Company's top executives are on skirts, stalkings, high heels and guess what, they wear lipstick, Yes lipstick and eye shadow. To make matters worse for the Adam generation, some Adams now wantedto be Eves. What a blow to a man's ego!!! Well, the real question here, is wether what women started with good intentions, has done them more good than harm .
I would say that at this point, it still stands an untold mystery. Consider the crimes committed against women, the unspeakable violations against the girl-child. Mental prisons created by the man-people against us women is all physical. It has nothing to do with Intelligence, Integrity or any form of Godly intentions. It is all physical, it a who is stronger than who game. Men in every society have always had an upperhand and wether we'd like to swallow it in or not, even in today's society they still do. It is a sad and heart tearing idea but it is true .
It all biols down to this communication. The message women in Beijin were trying to convey to men got misinterpreted by men, No guess who is responsible, the entertainment industry. Who said we didn't want to respect our Fathes, our Future husband, our brothers or our boyfriends? It is certainly not us. But because the message was interrupted, it never did what it was intended to do, instead, it did the opposite .
Yes! Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good!
