Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
It is true that our modern is filled with scince technology and industrialisation. But I tend to disagree that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Look Science and technology exists in the real world, so I don't see how can it hidder something like adream or imagination which is not for real or those not exists in the physical world .
Infact the world of Scince technology and in dustrialisation help the main concept of the dreaming and the imagining world in abig way I'll give you an example, 30 years ago people wouldn't dream of communicating globaly with their counterpart from anywhere in the world. But thanks to the dreaming of people like Bill Gates who dreamnt of one day owning his own software / Computer Company which today is possible for us to communicate via E-mail of his computers .
We can travel anywhere in the world because have airplanes thanks to some one whoinitialy had a concept in his mind that one day he want to Create an airplane in order to assist people to travel anywhere in the world. So we can say that thinking and imagining is part of Scince and techology .
They go hand in hand in order for thinks that are good for industries to be established so that we can live better as people is this world .
I mean even Cellphones, telephones they were created by people out of their imagination before they were established physically. Any were Science and technology plays an important role in our lifes I may elastrated even of electricity it is amiracle that was initially part a humans-imagination or adream of saying someday I want to establish some like that .
Imean things become more easy even for people who comes from previously disadvantaged communities, door of thinking more and more are opened for thanks to Scince and technology even ifrestructure is accessed easily unlike in previous years were by if you had a poem you would have to write on a tree or stone to keep it in record .
Now you can write it on a piece of paper or preferably type in using keyboard ofacomputer thanks to technology. You see things and dreaming is no longer just unreal thing on a humans mind but they can come real this time more easier because of the concept of Scince and technology. If want to design a Car I just draft it on my P.C. and Email / it to a certain Car manufacturer if they find it interesting then my dream has now become a visual reality and changes of me getting rich are more and doing that work of designing did not cost me a fortune thanks to Scince and technology. Even lives are being save in operating theaters because if a doctor has said to practice a certain operation but he is Germany but these skills are required here in South-Africa he can be contacted by video phone or other means of visual communication so that he may assist doctors in S.A. with out being travelling all the way from Germen all in all Science and technology is good for our every day lifes .
