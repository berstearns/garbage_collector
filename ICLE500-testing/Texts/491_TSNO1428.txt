Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Truly speaking, yes indeed feminists have done more harm to the cause of women in than good in our country. You get a case reported of assault everyday. I once made a research with my friend after a discussion of feminists. Immediately we went and asked why was women beaten so badly by men .
We got different answers and the most popular one was that they were not cooking and taking care of children. Rights of women, as the men said, are the once breaking the marriage, mostly these days especially at nights they forget that they have work to do, cooking and satisfying mens needs. They go out with other men while living their husbands in the house. Its not a right thing to beat a lady because she'll underestimate you as man. On the other side men are only looking for themselves, their rights. They like to exercise their rights than women. Ok women are oppressed by men in most cases .
I can say again feminist have done more harm to the cause of women than good. Sometimes men would like to have sex with wives, their wife don't feel like doing it then that's were problem start, men goes outside looking for another partner and his wife will be upset. Women have rights and men really need to take that in to consideration. The problem is, men feel like women are controlling them. Sometimes the culture, I mean the way women grew, sometimes she feels like it was rudeculous, and after marriage she finds and learn a lot about her rights, because sometimes, but always you mustn't do something that you don't like because its not going to do any good to or satisfy your feelings. Women are treated like animals and the things without them I don't think men can live without them .
Its not only that feminists have caused harm to women now; early before 1994, women were abused by men but it wasn't out like now. I think men and women should sit down together and think about their rights and what do those rights really mean and how to use freedom. Indeed rights are breaking the marriages. Women are threaghtned by men that they will divorce them if open the case against man. In most of the times women think they don't have a choice when they'll arrest their husbands because they are the only breadwinners in the house, If the husband is arrested who will support them .
As men say: the women sometimes pushes them to beat them; they will attend some occasion without telling them were they go and sometimes they'll go out with other men. Rights are really killing both women and men .
Both the other one wants this and the other one wants that thing. Maybe if will well talk to each other and try to know one another before getting into the marriage that will help us not to fight but live precious life .
