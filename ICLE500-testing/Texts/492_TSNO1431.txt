Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
I am very much for the idea that the world has been so technolized so much that there is no room for conventionalism. It is sad so see that the younger generation is so hooked onto these man-made devices, they have become dependent on modern technology such as tv. games, computers, calculators, telephones etc. to such an extend that if you asked them to perform certain tasks using basic tools they would not be able to finish those tasks .
Socially, people used to communicate by letters and word of mouth. whereas these have been replaced by telephones, computers and most recently electronic mail and cellular phones. Youngsters are now unable to utter a simple English phrase without slopping in some slang words or township lingo?s. It is my opinion that when, in the days old, people practiced languages by writting letters and so forth they improved their language skills considerably more compared to today. I believe that these inventions have spoilt the human race because we are so dependent on them we can not see ourselves doing manual things such as washing the dishes, we have to have a dishwasher to survive. This is pathetic of us, we are simply and purely becoming lazier and lazier by the day .
Educationally, when I was growing up it was my parents? duty to teach me about the world. They had time for me ? even after coming back from strenous work situations my father would sit down with me and teach me basic Arithmatic using butter beans or seeds of some fruit or sorts. When I began my Grade 1 in 1984 I could count, add, subtract and even write my name, never mind the writting of an ancient egyptian but at least I knew what letters of the alphabet constituted my name. Today?s generation need only one tool in mind, the calculator! They just punch away their little index fingers on the keys and out comes the answer. This affects them because they hardly exerase their brain cells therefore their brains become dorments. This makes it difficult for them in future because even if they knew the answer they would not how to present it because their brains have been inactive for a good part of their lives .
In the days of old kids learned by playing together in the street but today they just stare at their tv sets and instead of learning things of value, those that build character and instill good morals they watch violent cartoons which do more harm than falling while playing outside. They don?t have people who would teach by story-telling - this helped children to exercise their brains and intelligence by providing a platform for dreaming and imagine the characters in the stories told. They don?t even practice the culture of reading books for entertainment, they only read a book if its prescribed for their curriculum of when they need to research for an assignment .
One American study proved that about nine (9) out of ten (10) teenagers consume more electronic media than their counterparts ten years earlier and this proved detrimental as 60% of them ended up with offences ranging from violent outbreaks and unacceptable social behaviour some went as far as becoming juvenile deliquents. I understand, with the invention of mordernised devices, technology was meant to play a vital role in our lives, a role that would benefit the human race positively but seeing that it is doing more harm than good I think we should abolish it .
This is evident in the events of September 11, 2001 when the world remained static simply because of what happened in the U.S.A. South Africans were affected by witnessing the downfall of their currency. I believe that we should pack up all these man-made machines and go back to conventionalism. In conclusion man can no more be called the human race but the ?techno race? or ?the thumb race? as one chinese documentary puts it!
