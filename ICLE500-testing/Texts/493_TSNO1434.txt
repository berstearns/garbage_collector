Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
I can believe with people who say that in our modern world dominated by science and technology and industrialisation there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, because this is what is happening in out daily lives. Now these days is seems as every-thing is now being under the technology ideas. Each and every day some scientists are trying to find some way in which they can use by means of technology. They are doing some researches, and even at some schools some students are encouraged to take some science subjects, starting from the primary level .
I think that in the late centuries there were no auto-bank machines, traffic light, Computers communication device (eg telephone lines, mobile phones radio and television) but life was good to those people who live by that time. There was a way in which they can communicate and receive information of what is going on. Now these days we have some telephones lines, mobile phones, emails, ect, is which we can stay in touch with anyone around the world. And all of these has been developed by a human being, whom we can call a scientist. By radio and television we can receive information of what is happening around as and around the world. This is by means of technology bcease the television and the radio uses siginals. These signals has been developed by some scientist .
In every day of our lives we use technology, even when we are not aware of this. When we go to the automatic bank machiens (A.T.M.) to deposit or to withdraw money, we have used our knowledge of technology to operate that machine (A.T.M.)
Some of the jobs that are advertised in some newspapers by some employees will need only you if you are computer literate. Some big industies in todays lives uses some technology to operate some of the machiens. And this means that they will not need more employers to work the because some of the work need to be done will be for done machines. It is therefore I agree with thoso people who say our modern world, is dominated by science and technology and industrialisation and there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination. I?m saying this because if you have dreamed to be in a sertain position and that position is operated by means of or technology your dreams are good for nothing .
