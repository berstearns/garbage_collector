Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Women are thought to be the weaker sex. It was believed that a woman?s work is to stay at home and take care of the household and family. In the Old days women were not seen in offices or did not acquire higher jobs, because it was believed that only men were suitable for those jobs. Some women did not go to school at all while some went but never finished. At that time going to school was a waste of time because they were told that they had to help their mothers with the household chores and also prepare themselve for marriage .
I agree with this motion because women were not given chance to make something of themselves. Even if they went to school and finish, they could not study for the courses that they wanted, because men ruled the universe and told the women that some courses had to be done by men only. This harmed the cause of women because they were not allowed to do what they wanted. At that time women felt that they should not question what they were not allowed to do, but ended up believing that men were the one?s in power, because men were the breadwinners of the families .
This became so simple to the feminists because they had women where they wanted them, they were like party in their own hands. The whole world also came to believe that women were weak and could not do a man?s Job or think actively like a man. This harmed women in a way that they could not do anything for themselves except to take care of the family. Women were often abused by their husbands but they never asked for help because they believed that their husbands were the men of the house and it was okay for them to beat their women if they misbehave or try to make an opinion of something. Women started to believe that they were not clever and they can?t stand up for themselves .
Women are special in our lives. They bear childrens for their husbands and takes care of the whole family. A women knows when something is not right with her family and can make thing better. If feminist continue to harm them they will end up destroying them and will have no one to take care of them .
