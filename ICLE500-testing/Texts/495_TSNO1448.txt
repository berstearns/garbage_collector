Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Gender equality is what we aim to do, there will be no sexism. This is what feminists preach on a daily basis, but they never practice what they preach. Little or no change has been done .
A lot of women have been given bad treatment, and treated unfairly because of who they are. If you?re strong willed, and ambitious that is when people try by all means to bring you do. Gone are the days when men were regarded as the heads of houses. Gone are the days when this world was regarded as a ?man world?. If a woman makes it to the top, in this day in age, people still say they ?slept their way to the top?. If you?re a woman and have a high position, the men below you feel they don?t have to answer to you. As far as I?m concerned people who still think that way, have absolutely nothing going for them. They?re also disgustingly ignorant and narrow minded .
I?m not saying women should be given more power over men. All I?m saying is gender equality is what most women what. I don?t think you should be treated badly because of your gender, because you?re regarded as the weaker sex. People should learn to realise your values, your personality, they should look past your skirt. They should take time to analyse who you are, what you?re offering and why you?re really there .
Instead of being treated equally, they?re treated harshly. Because even today people are still living in the stone age, its sad but its true. I think the whole situation has gone worse. The more equality is preached, the more things deteriorate .
Something as brutal and ?spine-chilling? as rape still exists. Do you know why?, because women are regarded as weak, and the men as strong. Weak in this case because she couldn?t fight back, weak because she actually got raped. I?m not generalising, but unfortunately some people?s brains are pea-sized. So this is how they still think. Some women?s ego?s have been bruised and battered, their self esteem gone down the drain. Because subconsciouly this what they believe, that men will always be in control. That is why even today, for some women to actually make a decision they have to get the go ahead from their partners .
Some tswana cultures are to blame, to a certain extent. In some tswana cultures, you are by no means supposed to ask your husband. Where he?s been its rude, not to mention disrespectful. As well as when he verbally abuses you, you?re meant to keep quiet. Things like that were probably considered in the olden age. They shouldn?t still be considered today. Becauseb I?d like to think things have changed since those days. Or rather things should change, because if they don?t change... Then we shouldn?t ask for equality, and a better world .
