Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Most of students when the leave the university they seem not to know what to do when they are exposed to job situation. In most cases one will find that much time is spent on re-training them trying to equip them with relevant skills for whatever job they are to take as a career. Supervisors and other concerned parties are forced to leave their day to day activities to come to the rescue of the poor graduate who meets bottlenecks in practical exercise .
When people or colleagues find that a graduate is posted to their institution, they fill very happy and proud thinking that they are going to gain a lot from him because he would come with new ideas since he is fresh from a higher institution. Only to find that the person is vague, unskilled and expecting more from them, there is no exchange of knowledge since he knows close to nothing. He cannot perform any duty allocated to him by himself he needs close supervision which makes other people leaving their work to suffer and help the poor fellow .
Sometimes it takes time for the person to cope with the work situation, he needs time or even workshops to assist him. There would be a problem if one is posted to an istitution where members of the staff are not collaborative, they would leave him to suffer saying that let us see what he is going to do because he poccesses a degree. The graduate would feel that he is incompetent and decides to run away from his career because the university did not equip him with real work situation but theory .
Some fields such as agriculture, nursing, teaching etc need a lot of practical skills time and again during studying period at the university. Students should be taken to their relevant fields to be exposed to the work not just to be stuffed with assignments that do not do them any good at the end of the day. Expose them to the patients that they are going to nurse, to the students/learners that they are going to educate to the farms that they are going to work on .
So all in all we can say that the university is doing only 50% of the work (theory) and leave the other 50% (practical) for people in the field to finish it which is time consuming and delays productivity .
