Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Three years of one's life is spent reading reading and reading, if one is at a university. Where is the fun in it if all you do is read and don't get practical?
Other people may say that it is precise. True. But the only time you get to experience what you have been reading about is only when you have completed your studies, and some degrees take four years to complete even five if necessary. An example would be the LLB degree. It has a four-year curriculum and a five-year curriculum, and do believe me when I say after you complete your degree, you still have to go to a law school in order to be considered "qualified". But that does not guarantee you a job, you still have to hunt it down. How are companies going to recognise your capability if they do not know about you? That is what I think practically tries to emphasise, "your capability".
I consider university theory sacrete. I mean, whether you pass with distinctions and understand your studies very well, who knows about it hah? Only when you have completed your degree may you be considered to be "semi-qualified". Why "Semi"? Because experience plays a major role in one's ability to get a job. So if you don't have experience, people might as well refer to you as an "amateur". One would just crack thinking of the hell one went through, all those sleepless nights, trying to get it right .
Another thing about universities is that the cost a fortune! Some may say it is a challenge that one faces to study hard and get distinctions so that one can receive a bursary. Also true. But what happens then to a B-aggregate student hah?! The only way one can get a bursary is when one gets more than three distinctions. And what do we call this "psychologically"? We call it pressure!
Just because some students manage getting more than three distinctions does not mean "One can, all can" As individuals, we are all different. That is why we are reffered to as individuals. We all have our ways of doing, observing and understanding things and those ways aren't all the same. That is why we also have another concept called "perspective" which is defined as one's mental window through which one looks at reality. That's also why our population groups are divided into two groups, the other being rich ant the other being poor. This shows that not everyone does the same things, have the same things and has the same things .
In conclusion I want to say, students should be given an opportunity to explore you know, get practical. This will serve as another way of making it in life for students, especially those who cannot afford tuition fees. At least being practical and studying has a point. This point being that one gets more educated and becomes more better at what one does. Eventually all this leads to every worker's favourite word, "a raise".
There is a difference between knowing and understanding. When you know, is when you have seen or read something. But understanding is a whole new different concept. Understanding entails experience. That is what learning is all about, learning and understanding and in my opinion, universities contradict what I have just said. Afterall, how does one know something if they haven't really understood it???
