Most of the University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world / their new working place where they will be employed. University is different from the colleges and Technikon because they offer a practicals on their second and last year .
Times have changed its unlike the past years where you will be asked for a [?satain?] qualification and be employed. Today the situation is different the government and most of the private sectors require a practical experience and of at least 2 to five years. Think of all the hard time's you go through and the [?expeneess?] you lose, after all the hard work for four to five years at you institution then you graduate. After all the hard work of educating you self then you go and look for a job, when you get there they ask if you have [?ana?] experience of you Qualification .
During the segregation era people where encouraged to go to School now people have the education but they are not employed. Its even worse for the university students - because they have no practical experience even their refferences can not recommend them for a working experience, unlike Technikon Students. That is why people say universities are therefore of very little value for today's life time .
It's about time all the universities starts to consider this problem or the department of education, who ever is in charge must make sure that all university starts benefiting the students. Our government says its working towards a better life for all, if thats the case they should starts with the unemployment issue first because most of our brothers and sisters are educated but their at home and I am affraid that we might fall in the same trap .
I am very concerned about the problem because it might affect some of us. The government and the private sectors must stop asking for the experience that we don't have. How can you have a working experience when you have not worked before are still fresh from the university. I Think they are the ones that have to come up with a solution to the problem e.g. when they have vacant post's they should go to the different institutions and look for student who are busy with their last year and appoint them for different positions in different departments of the government .
If these issues are to be considered the problem can decrease with a high rate and some of the students can be motivated to work hard so that they can also get a chance to be short listed for the vacant post in certain companies or at different departments of the government .
