Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
In the time past women were oppressed by men in many ways than one. They could not be independent or even express themselves because everything or situations back then did not allow them. But now since we are living in a global world things are changing. Men did not allow women to be who they wished to be because it was [?t a worm?] that a woman's place is in the kitchen. So men generally were there main culprits as far as feminism is concerned. Even in places like a church, women were nor allowed to occypy leadership positions by men .
Today things have changed dramatically after the democratic changes in South Africa even in the World. But in Some Countries feminism is also a problem. In Communists or totaliterian countries women are still oppressed, in a way their talents are wasted. These led to women to unite against their governments .
In South Africa, during the apartheid regime women were oppressed by the government even in their communities. Bur they played a [?pivotent?] role in gaining their freedom and for their rights to be recognised. Culturally and traditionally women were oppressed by their husbands and the chiefs. It was a widespread problem for them. But they continued to fight for their independence and for to be treated as equals in the society .
After democratic elections in South Africa things changed. Women fought for their rights. In democratic countries or civilised societies women are treated as equals. Their independence helped them not to be treated as an inferior beings to men .
Unfortionately these independent women are misintepretting equality and independence as freedom. Some women feminist are out to prove a point that they can do things on their own. They don't care who gets hurt along the way. This is causing problems in the society or in many homes. Many families are broken or destroyed because women (feminists) cannot obey their husbands or atleast be mothers in their homes. They still want to exercise their new pound power over their husbands or families. So this is doing more harm than good to them because nobody wants to be with them let alone marrying them .
In Civilised societies, feminism is practiced by both men and women. We are now doing in an upnormal society because of these [/anisisfeprefations?] . Some women feminists are going for revenge against men or those who took away their independence for so long. Some spend the rest of their lives unmarried because nobody wants to be with them. Men choose to be with the less educated, rural women than with those who have many degrees / or more educated. They are bringing hot coals over themselves because of their egos. Education or [?Oudating?] big companies by these women is causing problems for them. They are materialist .
The heartbreaking issue is that of their kids. They grow up without father figures to look up to. They want to have control over everything. They are unable to distinguise their role as women in their homes as in the society. This is a problem not only for them but also for those who are close to them .
I believe women should be given a free role in the governance of the country and in their homes. But they should always remember that they are women. They need men to make things [?wornel?] for all concerned. Oppression over women is not good at all. Women's rights should not be violated. They are of course the weaker sex but they have rights and they should be respected by every body. Life is becoming unbearable because of feminism. It is doing more harm to men and women than good. We should respect each others rights. God created men and women to live together. We need each other to complement and fulfil each others abilities .
