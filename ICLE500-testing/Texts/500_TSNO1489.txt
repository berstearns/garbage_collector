Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Most university degrees are theoretical in so much that they do not prepare students for the real world. When thinking of theory part of it things seem to be more difficult because children learn by doing. So I am in an opinion that students be given as much practical work as they can because from the university one need to help the society he or she is going to meet in many different ways. If you are given more practical work, you will be able to deliver the content without problems, supposing you do nursing, and just do it theoretical, how is one going to handle different people with different deseases. Teachers at all levels can't teach without apparatus for pupils to understand the lesson very well. They will be made to handle the objects so that they click in their minds. They wont even forget what they were taught at a certain standard even when they are old men and women. Practical work in an important tool. It makes one to be more capable and sure of what he or she will be doing to the nation .
There are some subjects which need more practical than theory i.e. if you take science, Agriculture and Computer lessons. You can't tell a student that there is an instrument called thermometer which is used for body temperature. How is that very particular person going to identify it if she did not handle it and use it .
Most of our work demands a lot on practicals so let this method of being theoretical come to an end not meaning that it should be abolished altogether but be limited. Students should be taught exactly what they are there for because things will be more easy for them when they go back to their work station. This is the time whereby we are going to be called dead woods because one cant be a degree holder who cant even show the lower position holders that this is what I know and what I want you to do .
You cant teach pupils how to use an instrument which you dont know and you have never come across. I stress a point of not doing practicals as a concern. Let students be given their chance. Let the concerned people not deny student their chances of being capable and knowledgeable of performing their duties satisfactorily .
